<H2>Creativity & ICT</H2>
The purpose of this resource is to provide high quality guidance material for new Initial Teacher Education (ITE) tutors of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) that will help them explore the link between creativity and ICT.  It will provide:  
<ul><li>An exploration of the key points and issues.</li><li>Some practical ideas that tutors can use with their trainees.</li></ul>The authors strongly believe that all work with trainee teachers should support their development as  reflective practitioners and this resource has been created with that in mind.  It is designed to help the tutor generate discussion and research and provides a framework for planning ‘sessions’, with reference to further reading and resources.  Within the text, we have provided examples of possible activities, including:<ol><li>Discussion points  - activities that occur with the whole cohort or groups</li><li>Questions - undertaken by individuals to generate further thought and research and to refine ideas.  </li></ol><br><B>Introduction</B><br><br>Creativity is a key issue for educators.  The revision to the <a href="external.html?link=http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/key-stages-3-and-4/index.aspx" target="blank">Secondary National Curriculum for England</a> for 2008 highlights the importance of the topic.  The <a href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/partners/ittstandards/guidance_08.aspx" target="blank">Revised QTS standards</a>  (TDA (2007) Revised QTS Standards) and the <a href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/teachers/induction/corestandardsandassessment.aspx" target="blank">Core Standards</a> (TDA (2007) Core Standards for teachers) specifically mention it:<br><blockquote><B>Q8 and C8.</B> Have a creative and constructively critical approach towards innovation, being prepared to adapt their practice where benefits and improvements are identified (TDA 2007)<br></blockquote>It is a very challenging area to understand because:<ul><li>There has been a lack of consensus about what ‘creativity’ means</li><li>The academic writing associated with it can be very difficult to unravel.</li></ul>

<H1>1. What is creativity?</H1>
<BR>
<em><strong>Discussion point:</strong><BR>
There are many   definitions of creativity. <BR>
<BR>
1. Ask the trainees to discuss and share   their own initial thoughts with the cohort.</em><BR>
<BR>
There are two dominant   schools of thought about creativity, exemplified by Gibson (2005). The first, or   more &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; school of thought, associates it with self expression and the   arts (Renzulli (2002)) and the second, more pragmatic view, associates it with   producing outcomes that are useful (Loveless (2007), BECTA (2002)). The latter   is more influential in the development of current educational policy in England   and other countries.<BR>
<BR>
There are other more generic definitions of   creativity, including:
<UL>
  <LI>Kim (2007), who states that it is an individual and cultural phenomenon   which allows us to transform possibilities into reality;  
  <LI>Nelson (2005), who implies that there is a link between creative thought and   problem solving;  
  <LI>Aldous (2005), building on this thought, who describes it as a process   resulting in unique, usable ideas;  
  <LI>Northcott, Miliszewska and Dakich (2007), who suggest that it entails   different intelligences working together through a combination of thinking and   innovation;   
  <LI>BECTA (2002), which states that the ability to take what one already has or   knows and use it in new and different ways is connected to   creativity.</LI>
</UL>
This does not represent all the alternative views about   creativity. Trainee teachers and tutors are encouraged to refer to <A href="text_only12c1.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=14&ts=9">References   and resources</A>. <BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Discussion Point: </em></strong><BR>
The current   &lsquo;official&rsquo; definition in the National Curriculum (England) describes creativity   as having four characteristics:
<UL>
  <LI><em>It always involves thinking or behaving imaginatively; </em>
  <LI><em>It involves activity that is purposeful i.e. is directed to achieving an   objective; </em>
  <LI><em>It involves processes that generate something original; </em>
  <LI><em>The outcome must be of value in relation to the objective(s).</em></LI>
</UL>
It   originated with a report commissioned by the then Secretary of State for   Education and Employment in May 1999 on Creativity, Culture and Education and   was produced by the National Advisory Committee on Creative and Culture   Education (NACCCE) - see &lsquo;All Our Futures&rsquo; (DfES 1999). <BR>
<BR>
Ask the trainee   teachers to:
<OL>
  <LI><em>Consider the range of definitions, including the &lsquo;official&rsquo; one </em>
  <LI><em>Identify which most closely fits with their own   interpretation.</em></LI>
</OL>
<p><strong><em>Question.</em></strong> Why do you think the pragmatic view of   creativity (outcomes) is predominant in English education?<BR>
  <BR>
  author:   Andy Connell &amp; Tony Edwards<BR>
</p>
<H1>2. Is creativity exclusive?</H1>
<BR>
There are two contrasting viewpoints in   the literature that are explored here. Stein (1956) and Rezulli (2002) exemplify   one, that it is an activity only undertaken by individuals with exceptional   &lsquo;talent&rsquo; in very specific areas such as music and painting. They believe that   creativity requires independence of mind and unusualness and that within   education it is associated with the achievement and outcomes of the gifted and   talented. The counterview is exemplified by Runco (2002), who asserts that   everyone can be creative whether they are engaged in meaningful activity or not   and that it is not confined the arts communities alone.
<UL>
  <LI>Other writers agree: Northcott, Miliszewska and Dakich, (2007) believe that   the capacity to produce creative thought is universal.   
  <LI>Loveless, (2007) asserts that pupils of all abilities are capable of   expressing creativity and that it can manifest itself in any subject including   sporting activities or more practical subjects like technology or Information   and Communication Technology (ICT).  
  <LI>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIe) in Scotland suggest that it   is possible to have creativity in all areas but in some it is easier to   encourage more than in others because it necessitates open ended activities,   personal interpretation, self expression and choice (HMIe 2006)  
  <LI>Cowley (2005) argues that there is scope within any subject for creativity   but it is dependent upon the imagination of teachers and their willingness to   take a few risks.</LI>
</UL>
Current educational policy in England and other   countries is influenced by this inclusive view.<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Discussion point: </em></strong><BR>
The assertion that everyone can be creative depends how you define it   and is, nevertheless, still contentious. The introduction of the concept of &lsquo;big   C and little C&rsquo; creativity, which builds on the work of Gardner (1993), helps to   illuminate the debate and supports the notion of creativity for all. It implies,   on one hand, that there are unique people, such as Da Vinci and Steve Jobs who   generate ideas or outcomes that have a profound impact on society. They are   imbued with &lsquo;big C&rsquo; creativity and are few and far between. On the other hand,   &lsquo;little c&rsquo; creativity is associated with making small positive changes to what   is mundane and ordinary. Everyone has this capacity. <BR>
<BR>
Ask the trainee   teachers to:
<OL>
  <LI><em>Consider whether the concept of &lsquo;big C and little c&rsquo; creativity can apply to   both of the dominant schools of thought discussed in section 1? </em>
  <LI><em>Discuss whether the notion of &lsquo;big C and little c&rsquo; creativity is viable. </em></LI>
</OL>
<p><strong><em>Question:</em></strong> Read the opening sections (page 1) of the article   &lsquo;Are Autodidacts Creative?, by Margaret Bowden found at <A href="external.html?link=http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/courses/creative-systems/papers/maggie/autodidacts.pdf" target="blank"><em>http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/courses/creative-systems/papers/maggie/autodidacts.pdf</em></A> . Reflect on the &lsquo;P and H&rsquo; model of creativity that she advocates. How might   this inform the debate on exclusivity/inclusivity of   creativity?<BR>

<H1>3. ICT and Creativity</H1>
<BR>
<CENTER>
  How can ICT support creativity?
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
There are many writers   who have attested to the capacity of ICT to support creativity (Tinio (2003),   Alsina (2006), Wergerif R &amp; Dawes (2004)). They have identified three   distinct aspects to this support. The first is related to the equipment and what   you can do with it. The second is how it changes the relationship between the   learning and the learner. The third is &lsquo;risk taking&rsquo;.<BR>
<BR>
The first aspect,   that ICT can allow activities that otherwise would not be possible, has been   well documented e.g. ICT enables access to a wide range of resources, enhanced   communication, more powerful data manipulation and simulation of real world   events.
<UL>
  <LI>Tinio (2003) states that: &lsquo;When used appropriately, ICTs - especially   computers and Internet technologies - enable new ways of teaching and learning   rather than simply allow teachers and students to do what they have done before   in a better way.&rsquo;   
  <LI>Loveless (2007) argues that digital technologies allow users to do things   that could not be done as effectively or at all. She has also provided a   framework for analysing the impact of ICT on creativity. . She notes that when </LI>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&lsquo;&hellip; considering how digital technologies might support learning, the   affordances of the technologies can be described in &lsquo;clusters&rsquo; of purposeful   activity: knowledge building; distributed cognition; community and   communication; and engagement.&rsquo;<BR>
  (Loveless, 2007 p.7)</BLOCKQUOTE>
The second   aspect is that there is a change in relationship between the pupil and teacher.   Strong individualism, which leads the learner to take ownership of their own   learning, is a key characteristic of the creative person.
<UL>
  <LI>Tinio (2003) suggests that ICT leads to new ways of teaching and learning   that are underpinned by constructivist theories of learning and constitute a   shift from a teacher-centered pedagogy to one that is   learner-centered.</LI>
</UL>
The third is that it provides an environment, through   simulation and feedback, in which taking a risk can be a positive experience.
<UL>
  <LI>&lsquo;Timidity is not conducive to creativity. Fear is seen as a major reason why   children hesitate to express their ideas, especially perhaps unconventional   ones&rsquo; (Freeman, 1983).  
  <LI>&lsquo;Fear of failure, fear of exposing one&rsquo;s limitation, and fear of ridicule   are powerful deterrents to creative thinking or at least to public exposure of   products of creative efforts. &lsquo;(Crutchfield, 1962).</LI>
</UL>
<em><strong>Discussion   Point:</strong><BR>
Ask trainees to identify examples of ICT supporting creativity   that they have observed in schools. Use the table below to summarise the   findings, if possible, bearing in mind that it is sometimes difficult to   compartmentalise each aspect.</em><BR>

<em>This table, when completed, should generate   some interesting debate on the nature of creativity in   schools.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Question:</strong> Some writers argue (Wickens, C (2007); Loveless   (2007; Wegerif (2004)) that before learners can use ICT to be creative,   capability is required. Do you agree? Are there other barriers to creativity   using ICT and how might they be overcome?</em><BR>

<H1>4. Assessing creativity </H1>
<BR>
<CENTER>
  How do you assess creativity in ICT?
</CENTER>
<BR>
There is ongoing debate   about whether you should assess creativity and if so, how. The full debate is   beyond the scope of this resource. However, there are two main approaches that   have been adopted by those who believe you can assess it.<BR>
<BR>
The first is   about identifying general characteristics of someone who is being creative:
<UL>
  <LI>NACCCE list the characteristics as: adaptability, the capacity to make   connections between things, imagination, purposefulness, originality, the skills   to properly manage the growth of an idea and a capacity to evaluate.  
  <LI>Mihaly Csikszentmilhalyi (1996) has developed a more prescriptive list. He   suggests that a creative person will: be able to set clear goals, recognise   flaws in ideas easily, ignore extraneous distractions, focus thinking clearly,   cope with the fear of failure, apply different intelligences to problem solving,   engage in autotelic activity, will possibly lose all sense of time and   self.</LI>
</UL>
The second is a more empirical approach led by E. Paul Torrance.
<UL>
  <LI>The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) (Torrence, E. P. (1966))   involve simple figural or verbal tests of divergent thinking and other problem   solving skills in which participants are scored on their fluency (the total   number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to   a stimulus), flexibility (the number of different categories of relevant   responses), originality (the statistical rarity of the responses) and   elaboration (the amount of detail in the responses).</LI>
</UL>
<strong><em>Discussion   Point: </em></strong><BR>
It is interesting to note, that each of these writers contend   that anyone can be creative, but that the work of Torrance in particular has   been associated with identifying gifted and talented pupils (in USA) i.e. in an   &lsquo;exclusive&rsquo; way.<BR>
Ask the trainee teachers to:
<OL>
  <LI><em>Discuss what the barriers to measuring creativity might be. </em>
  <LI><em>Discuss these two approaches and the implications for classroom   practice.</em></LI>
</OL>
<strong><em>Question: </em></strong>Are there alternative approaches to the   assessment of creativity? <BR>
<BR>

<H1>5. Creativity in schools</H1>
<BR>
<CENTER>
  What might this mean in relation to practice in   schools?
</CENTER>
<BR>
When ICT and creativity are thought of together, many   educational agencies (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.becta.org.uk/" target="blank">BECTA</A>, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.qca.org.uk/" target="blank">QCA</A> and <A href="external.html?link=http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/" target="blank">DCSF</A>) cite examples that are based on the use of digital   technologies to create multimedia packages. Whilst this can demonstrate   creativity it is difficult to break away from the association between being   creative and the arts. The authors believe that there is a more fundamental link   between the use of ICT and creativity that can occur in the classroom. <BR>
<BR>
An illustration of this link might be the use of hardware and software   that enables speculation and simulation to take place. At one end of the scale,   something as apparently simple as a spreadsheet uniquely allows learners to   readily explore the consequences of changing inputs on potential outcomes. At   the other end of the scale, Beacon Primary School, Crescent Girls&rsquo; School,   Jurong Secondary School (JSS), Hwa Chong Institute (HCI) and Canberra Primary   School in Singapore have been charged with trialling cutting edge technologies   in the classroom which will establish &ldquo;immersive learning environments&rdquo;. (<A href="external.html?link=http://www3.moe.edu.sg/futureschools/future_schs.htm" target="blank">http://www3.moe.edu.sg/futureschools/future_schs.htm</A>). These   will take a number of different forms, including the facility to create 'virtual   field trips&rsquo;, in which the students will have access to virtual locations, such   as eco-life systems in deserts and mountains, or even a journey through the   blood circulatory system of the human body. The air, temperature and humidity in   the classroom can be controlled and synchronised with visual and sound effects   to support the illusion. Theoretically learners can interact with the virtual   environment to change outputs. Both of these examples are meant to engage   students in a manner otherwise impossible through conventional textbook teaching   methods and allow them to explore the consequences of change, without risk of   failure or sanction. They do not automatically lead to creativity in learners,   but could do so if the activity they are engaged is appropriately   framed.<BR>
<BR>
Another illustration is that ICT can lead to liberation of the   curriculum that allows learning based around problem solving. ICT projects which   allow pupils to identify a problem, consider a range of possible solutions and   then solve the problem have great scope for creativity (according to the   official definition). <BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Discussion point:</em></strong><BR>
Influential figures   such as <A href="external.html?link=http://www.heppell.net/" target="blank"><em>Steven   Heppell</em></A> suggest that primary schools are better positioned than secondary   schools to promote creativity in learners at this point in the early 21st   century.<BR>
Ask the trainees to:
<OL>
  <LI><em>Investigate what Heppell is saying (see <A href="external.html?link=http://www.rm.com/Primary/InTheNews/Article.asp?cref=MNEWS1142145& SrcURL=/primaryinform2008" target="blank">http://www.rm.com/Primary/InTheNews/Article.asp?cref=MNEWS1142145&amp;   SrcURL=/primaryinform2008</A> Professor Steven Heppell talking to the Primary   INFORM Conference, 2008, and <A href="external.html?link=http://www.teachers.tv/video/4957" target="blank">http://www.teachers.tv/video/4957</A> Professor Steven Heppell&rsquo;s   2006 RSA lecture on future learning). </em>

  <LI><em>Discuss how these could inform what trainee teachers might do during their   school placements.</em></LI>

<H1>6. Supporting trainee teachers</H1>
<BR>
<CENTER>
  How can we support ICT trainee teachers in planning and delivering   creative lessons?
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
In this section we are assuming the &lsquo;official&rsquo;   line that creativity is not exclusive and ought to be encouraged in all   learners. <BR>
<BR>
There is a range of good pedagogical practices that we   encourage our trainees to follow, which may have an impact on creativity in the   classroom. However, in promoting creativity there are a number of additional key   questions we need to get them to consider:
<UL>
  <LI>Is your planning based around problem-solving? (see Nelson (2005))  
  <LI>Have you provided opportunities for the learner to produce something   original? (see Aldous (2005); BECTA (2002))  
  <LI>Have you provided opportunities for the learner to produce something of use?   (see Loveless (2007), BECTA (2002))  
  <LI>Are there opportunities for the learners to experiment and take risks? (see   Freeman (1983), Crutchfield(1962))  
  <LI>Have you provided opportunities for learning to take place both individually   and cooperatively? (see Feist (2008))  
  <LI>Have you provided opportunities for learners to think and act independently?   (see Csikszentmihalyi (1996))  
  <LI>Are there opportunities for self-expression? (see Renzulli (2002))  
  <LI>Are there opportunities for learners to challenge the status quo? (see   Renzulli (2002))  
  <LI>Are there opportunities for learners to evaluate? (see NACCCE (1999))  
  <LI>Does the learning experience lend itself to making connection between   different sets of knowledge, skills and understanding? (see NACCCE   (1999))</LI>
</UL>
<strong><em>Discussion Point:</em></strong><BR>
Learners will be at different   stages in their creative development at different times. <BR>
Ask the trainees to   discuss:
<OL>
  <LI><em>What influence this could have on their practice, in relation to the   questions above?</em></LI>
</OL>
<strong><em>Question:</em></strong> What might the possible impacts on   classroom management be of encouraging learners to take risks, challenge the   status quo and think and act independently?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Discussion   Point:</em></strong><BR>
Creativity is identified as a cross-curricular dimension of the   statutory revised National Curriculum for England - see <BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/key-stages-3-and-4/cross-curriculum-dimensions/creativitycriticalthinking/index.aspx" target="blank"><em>http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/key-stages-3-and-4/cross-curriculum-dimensions/creativitycriticalth<BR>
inking/index.aspx</em></A> . Officially, we can and should teach it. The guidance states that the Secondary   Strategy will provide support in this area.
<OL>
  <LI><em>Ask the trainees to examine the guidance on creativity on the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.qca.org.uk/" target="blank">QCA</A> web site   and the <A href="external.html?link=http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/secondary/ict" target="blank">Standards</A> web site. </em>
  <LI><em>Discuss how useful the guidance is in promoting creativity in   ICT.</em></LI>
</OL>
<strong><em>Question: </em></strong>Explore how useful the work of <A href="external.html?link=http://www.creative-partnerships.com/" target="blank"><em>Creative Partnerships</em></A> is (this is an organisation that is   funded by the Arts Council for England to support creativity in schools and   trainees may come across their work in schools).<BR>
<BR>
author: Andy Connell   &amp; Tony Edwards<BR>
<H1>7. Other Issues</H1>
<BR>
Although the link between creative teaching and this   process has not been explored thoroughly, we suspect that creativity in pupils   is more likely to result from exposure to role models who teach creatively.   Similarly, we suspect that creativity in trainees is more likely to result from   exposure to you as a creative role model. Therefore, ITE providers need to   evaluate their own practice, by using the questions in section six and by asking   the additional question:
<UL>
  <LI>In assessing trainee teacher lessons and giving feedback, do you look for   and comment on creativity?</LI>
</UL>
Trainees spend a considerable amount of   their time in schools and it is there that they put the theory into practice. It   is essential, therefore, that ITE providers work with mentors in schools to   develop a collective understanding and take joint responsibility in supporting   trainees with creativity.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Discussion Point:</strong><BR>
Sir Ken   Robinson, the chairman of NACCCE and author of &lsquo;The Element: How Finding Your   Passion Changes Everything&rsquo; (2009), argues that we have been educated to become   good workers, rather than creative thinkers. A speech he made to the Technology,   Entertainment and Design (TED) Conference in February 2006 has been widely   distributed and acclaimed.<BR>
<BR>
1. Watch the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html" target="blank">TED video</A> and discuss the implications for the ICT classroom of   what Sir Ken Robinson says. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>Discussion Point:</strong><BR>
We are in the   early stages of debate about whether there is a link between the teacher being   creative and the capacity of pupils to be creative. <BR>
Ask the trainee teachers   to:
<OL>
<ul>
  <LI>Discuss if there is a relationship between the two?  
  <LI>Debate whether you can be a creative ICT teacher without using ICT   equipment? <BR>
