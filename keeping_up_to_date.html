<H2>Keeping Up-to-Date</H2>
<br>Keeping up to date is a concern for all tutors.  Government departments and agencies and professional associations have informative websites and publications but looking for the latest information on each of them is time consuming.  There is a range of alerting services that will relieve your burden and bring the information to your computer.  These include email alerts, e-newsletters and magazines, and RSS (really simple syndication) feeds.  In addition, email lists and forums can be useful for exchanging views and interpretations of new developments and their implications for your work. <br><br>Here is a selection of alerting services that ICT tutors have found useful.  Some of these cover educational issues in general, whilst others focus on ICT in education.    Which will be the most suitable for you will depend on your personal interests and preferences. Try just two or three in the first instance to see if they suit your needs.  You can always unsubscribe and try different ones at a later date.<br><br>Most of the services are freely available but some are only available to paying subscribers.<br><br><B>Information from UK Government sources</B><br><br><B> <i>Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF)</B><br>The UK government Department for Children, Schools and Families provides a fortnightly email news service that brings all the latest news and guidance into your inbox.
