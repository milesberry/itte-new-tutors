<H2>Overview of e-portfolios and e-assessment in teacher education</H2>
<p><br>
  This section of the website looks at both e-assessment and e-portfolios with a particular emphasis on applications to initial teacher education. A number of case studies are included which are indicative of how different institutions are exploring and developing their thinking in these areas. In essence e-assessment is about measuring some facet of the learner whilst an e-portfolio is about the learner compiling an electronic record of their learning experience. Often in teacher education the compilation of an e-portfolio plus a reflective journal constitutes the assessment task. Hence this section deals with both topics as one, recognising that in HE the distinction is not always clear.<br>Aspects of this topic are covered in the following sections:<br><br>

<BR>
Definitions of e-portfolios and e-assessment can be   found on the e-futures site (a QCA initiative)<BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://www.efutures.org/graphics/e_portfolios.html" target="blank">www.efutures.org/graphics/e_portfolios.html</A>. From this site it   is also possible to download <em>&ldquo;e-assessment: Guide to effective practice&rdquo;</em> (this also covers e-portfolios).<BR>
<BR>
The QCA view on e-assessment is   summarised in the statement below:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;QCA believes that e-assessment and e-learning plays an important   role in the future of education and training. QCA wants to ensure that   technology plays a key role in the learning and assessment systems of the   future. Technology must provide a valid and reliable learning platform, it must   be robust and accessible. Above all, it must improve and enrich   education.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
It   appears that in HE more emphasis has been put on e-portfolios than on   e-assessment. This is partly a consequence of students needing to show evidence   of attainment and meeting standards. By comparison school examination boards are   actively exploring e-assessment, driven by the need to test cohorts of thousands   of pupils over a national area in a standardised and robust manner. This section   will not focus on the school environment but instead will look at what is   happening in institutes of HE, and in particular the pedagogical gains that   these developments offer. <BR>

<H1>Characteristics of today's learners</H1>
<BR>
Initially we should ask why we   are going down this route at all and to answer this we need to look at the   characteristics of today&rsquo;s learners. Traditional assessment has served us well   but we are going through a cultural change. The traditional lecture is detached   from reality. Students expect more interactivity, they expect tutors to use the   tools that are natural to today&rsquo;s learners. Contemporary skills are not   listening and note taking, but are based around collaboration, discussion,   communication, problem solving and flexibility. With students having instant   access to Google or Wikipedia, memorisation is no longer the essential skill   that it was in the past. Students of today are used to:
<UL>
  <LI>Video on demand  
  <LI>Portable access to the internet  
  <LI>Social networking through sites such as Facebook, Bebo, MySpace etc  
  <LI>Cell phones with in built cameras  
  <LI>VOIP (Voice over IP) such as Skype  
  <LI>Personalised digital music anthologies  
  <LI>On-lone virtual worlds such as Second Life  
  <LI>User-generated content creation sites such as YouTube for video and Flickr   for photos  
  <LI>Blogs, wikis and document sharing sites such as Google Docs  
  <LI>Instant messaging  
  <LI>On-line shopping and banking</LI>
</UL>
Passive learning is no longer de   rigueur. Learning has to be active, with authentic tasks and goal oriented. In   fact assessment 2.0 has to be:
<UL>
  <LI>Authentic  
  <LI>Natural  
  <LI>Personalised  
  <LI>Negotiated  
  <LI>Problem based  
  <LI>Collaborative  
  <LI>Peer and self-assessed  
  <LI>Tool supported &ndash; text/audio/video</LI>
</UL>
All this points to the fact that   in such a rapidly changing environment HE has to reconsider the teaching,   learning and assessment environments.<BR>
<BR>
In the area of e-assessment, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.ciea.org.uk/news_and_events/annual_conference/day1.aspx" target="blank">Dr Randy Bennett&rsquo;s presentation </A>at the Institute of Educational   Assessors National Conference, May 2007 provides a thoughtful insight as to   where we are at present and the potential gains. <BR>
<BR>
He describes three   stages in the development of e-assessment.
<OL>
  <LI>The first generation focuses on infrastructure and automating existing   processes.   
  <LI>The second generation concerns advances in technology and measurement   science, together with insights into learning, but still serves &ldquo;institutional   constituencies&rdquo;.   
  <LI>The third generation (and we are not there yet) is about reinvention.   Learning and assessment, both at a distance and on demand, is a challenge still   to be solved. It is about a complete radical rethink focused on the needs of the   learners.</LI>
</OL>
In fact, the first generation is firmly established and is   evidenced by the driving theory test and the trainee teachers test for literacy   and numeracy. The second generation is more problematic. The emphasis should be   put on the testing process rather than the marking convenience; enabling the   students to demonstrate what they have learnt.<BR>
<BR>
Bennett identifies 5 key   points where the internet has features that will prove invaluable for   e-assessment:
<UL>
  <LI>Interactive &ndash; capable of presenting a test to a student and responding   quickly to a student&rsquo;s actions  
  <LI>Switched &ndash; able to engage in different interactions with different students   simultaneously  
  <LI>Broadband &ndash; capable of carrying a great deal of information economically  
  <LI>Networked &ndash; connected and joined up  
  <LI>Standards based &ndash; operating to a set of conventional rules that all   participants follow.</LI>
</UL>
<BR>

<H1>E-portfolios in the HE environment</H1>
<BR>
E-portfolios enable tutors to   track, monitor, assess and communicate with students, but to be really   worthwhile they must also offer a real benefit to the student. From the student   viewpoint they can offer:
<UL>
  <LI>On-line coursework submissions  
  <LI>Interim feedback from tutors   
  <LI>Timely student feedback which is also on-line (hence readable)  
  <LI>Student work can be made available to peers and other tutors  
  <LI>Reflective observations can be written which take into account comments from   tutors and peers.</LI>
</UL>
As an aside, one form of reflection is through the   medium of patchwork texts. The characteristics of a patchwork text assignment   are that it is:
<UL>
  <LI>gradually assembled  
  <LI>enables students to meet the learning outcomes by using a series of small   assignments/activities  
  <LI>shared with a small group of students  
  <LI>incremental steps lead to progression  
  <LI>&lsquo;stitched&rsquo; together with a final, reflective wrapper</LI>
</UL>

<BR>
The crucial issue about an e-portfolio is that it should be more than a   system of on-line storage. Overall, it must be seen to have some real long term   worth and value to the &lsquo;owner&rsquo;. It affords the learner the following benefits:
<UL>
  <LI>Assessment is not end loaded - intelligent use of the uploaded resources   will allow tutors to intervene early in cases where some students need extra   help or guidance  
  <LI>It is a record of evidence for lifelong learning. It is portable in that   students should be able to take it with them upon leaving their HE institution   and it is also easy to refine and adapt. It should mature with the student as a   lifelong learning tool, logbook, academic diary, etc  
  <LI>It also allows for e-collaborative learning, either students being able to   view and comment upon each other&rsquo;s work (through a discussion forum, wikki,   google docs, etc) or, as with the patchwork text referred to above, students   working collaboratively on a joint task  
  <LI>The e-portfolio can contain digital images, video clips, simple animations,   audio files, web pages; none of which can be easily represented in a paper based   portfolio.</LI>
</UL>
JISC ran a project entitled &lsquo;The Learner&rsquo;s Voice&rsquo; (2007) and   as part of it groups of students each made a short video about their experiences   of some aspects of e-learning. Jenny and Emma each talk about their e-portfolio   and what it means to them. The video lasts about 5 minutes.

<H1>E-assessment in the HE environment</H1>
<BR>
<strong>Two Approaches to   e-assessment</strong><BR>
There are two approaches that are commonly recognised. The   first is to provide some form of computerised test that can be marked instantly   by the computer and hence give the student immediate feedback. The ICT skills   test that all students have to take is an example of this. The second approach   is where the assessment is completed at a PC but the results have to be hand   marked by the tutor. This is normally applicable in circumstances where students   are asked for a free text answer based upon their opinion, interpretation or   analysis. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>Why PC-based assessment?</strong><BR>
Regarding this second   approach it might be reasonable to ask why is this a PC based form of assessment   (after all, students have hand written essays for decades)? Most students will   give the answer that a keyboard, and not handwriting, is the natural form of   their written expression. They are used to drafting and redrafting and hand   writing one hour timed essays is an anathema to them. From the tutor&rsquo;s point of   view the outcome is also typed so that he/she can concentrate on the content of   the answer as opposed to spending half of their time trying to decode the   handwriting. Even in free text answers that the tutor has to mark manually, it   is possible to provide instant feedback in the form of model answers. Students   will then be able, whilst fresh in their memory, to reflect on whether or not   they have considered the key points.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Assessment anywhere,   anytime?</strong><BR>
In principle this assessment could be anywhere, anytime, but in   practice this is not often the case. Society is not yet ready for a system   whereby the student can take an assessment in her kitchen on a Saturday   afternoon whilst the rest of the family are at the Emirates Stadium watching   Arsenal. However, this can be the case if the assessment is for formative and   not summative purposes. The TDA Numeracy Test, for example, can be practiced   from home, but the definitive test has to be undertaken in a secure and   supervised environment.<BR>
<BR>
Although &ldquo;anywhere, anytime&rdquo; is a principle that   we are still working towards, if a secure environment can be established then   &ldquo;anytime&rdquo; can be implemented now. Tests have to be set up so that there is a   large question bank and/or, where applicable, randomised questions. This will   ensure that one student who takes the test early can not give an added advantage   to their peers. It also has the advantage that resits can be taken at any time   once the tutor thinks that the student has spent appropriate time and effort   addressing their weaknesses.<BR>

<H1>Scenario - the HE reality</H1>
<BR>
It is approaching the end of May. You have   taught three groups of 30 postgraduates each over a period of 10 weeks. They   have built up a portfolio of evidence to show what skills, knowledge and   understanding they have acquired. They have also written a 2000 word essay   reflecting on how their newly acquired knowledge might enhance their teaching in   the classroom. You have a phone call from the Exams and Assessment office to say   that the students' work is ready for collection. &ldquo;It is quite bulky, do you want   the porters to deliver it to you? There are 8 boxes all together&rdquo;. Your heart   sinks &ndash; surely there must be another way!<BR>
<BR>
Some institutions are beginning   to look at different solutions to solving this perennial problem. However,   whichever solutions are adopted, they should offer more than a convenient way to   alleviate assessment bottlenecks for the tutor. The overriding question is   whether assessment been used effectively and meaningfully.<BR>
<BR>
The six case   studies included in this section are not necessarily exemplary accounts, but are   put forward by the tutors involved in order to share experiences and to indicate   pointers for future developments.<BR>

<H1>Case studies</H1>
<BR>
<strong>1. University of Wolverhampton</strong><BR>
A paper on   &ldquo;The use of e-portfolios and blogging in Teacher Education&rdquo; by Julie Hughes from   the University of Wolverhampton is available on the JISC InfoNet site:<BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://www.jiscinfonet.ac.uk/case-studies/tangible/wolverhampton/index_html1" target="blank">http://www.jiscinfonet.ac.uk/case-studies/tangible/wolverhampton/index_html1</A><BR>
This   case study illustrates an effect on learning, an effect on exam results and an   effect on student personal development. It also looks at student satisfaction   with both e-learning and innovation in teaching and learning. The paper also   focuses on staff satisfaction with e-learning and the hurdles that need to be   overcome in this area including changes from policy on the one hand to   redesigning learning spaces on the other.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>2 University of   Worcester.</strong> <BR>
Moira Savage describes a relatively new project with 20 PGCE   students at the University of Worcester. The students have used PebblePAD to   compile an e-portfolio of their ICT related work. Moira explains what is   included in the portfolio and why she thinks it is superior to the previous   paper version. Whilst she also recognises its limitations, its strengths are   such that it is here to stay.<BR>

<strong>4.   University of Northampton</strong><BR>
Gareth Honeyford describes an e-portfolio   system that he is pursuing with undergraduates at University of Northampton.   This is based upon Powerpoint (or any alternative framework that the student   wants to use). In essence it is a series of templates to which the students   upload their evidence (and ultimately save as a CD).<BR>

<strong>5.   University of Southampton</strong><BR>
John Woollard describes a bespoke open source,   but relatively long established, system that they have been using at the   University of Southampton (initiated through a TDA grant in 2001). John   discusses the affordances that the system offers and also highlights how they   would like to see the system developing in the future.<BR>

<strong>6.   University of Wolverhampton</strong><BR>
Sarah Weatherhead describes how the use of   PebblePAD with early years students has enabled them to communicate better, to   be more reflective and to be more confident users of the technology. Moreover   there has been a significant shift in how they perceive teaching and   learning.<BR>
Download Acrobat document: <A href="documents/wolverhampton.pdf">wolverhampton.pdf</A> (1860K)<BR>
<BR>
All   these case studies have an element of experimentation about them, but all   recognise that e-portfolios are the way to go and are superior to the paper   version and the associated overloaded files where quantity seems to take   precedent over quality. There are distinct affordances in terms of students   being able to provide evidence in different formats rather than just the   written. There are opportunities for on-going formative assessment, sometimes by   peers and sometimes by tutors. E-portfolios also offer the latter a monitoring   facility which enables tutors to intervene much quicker in cases where they   think particular students need help or prompting. Sharing and collaboration can   be much enhanced. RSS feeds can also alert tutors to the fact that a student has   updated their portfolio.<BR>
<BR>
However, there are still problems to be   overcome. Some are legalistic in terms of data protection (ie. including video   of children at work for example) and some are technical in terms of transporting   the e-portfolio to a different platform once the student&rsquo;s course is complete. <BR>
