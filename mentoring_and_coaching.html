<H2>Mentoring and Coaching - Introduction</H2>
<p><br>
  <b>Introduction</b><br><br>The purpose of this resource is to provide you with the knowledge, skills and understanding you need to support and train school-based mentors with whom you will be working as a university tutor or co-ordinator for a school-based training provider. The processes, procedures and documentation used by each training provider may differ – but the purposes and outcomes will be the same: to enable student-teachers to maximise their potential in becoming effective teachers. These resources are designed to support you in achieving this objective.<br><br>
  <b>Overview of the resource</b><br><br>
  <b><i><a href="text_only7d74.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=2">What is mentoring and coaching?</a> </i></b><br>This provides you with background information about the role of the mentor, the coach and the co-coach (or peer-coach). This should help to clarify your understanding of the interplay between these roles and thus support you when training mentors and coaches.<br><br>
  <b><i><a href="text_only7e00.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=3">The skills of mentoring and coaching</a></i></b><br>This section explores the skills and strategies which mentors and coaches need to employ to carry out their roles. This includes: review and reflection, observation and feedback, target setting and assessment.<br><br>
  <b><i><a href="text_onlyf01b.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=4">Training, developing and supporting mentors and coaches</a></i></b><br>This section provides you with some ideas and resources for inducting and developing the expertise of mentors with whom you will be working. Training for mentors can be provided through formal, centre-based training sessions or through one-to-one school-based contact. Included in this section are examples of activities and resources which might prove useful in clarifying your role in training and supporting mentors with whom you are working.<br><br>
  <b><i><a href="text_only2938.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=5">Quality assurance of school-based provision</a></i></b><br>Part of your role in co-ordinating school-based training as an ICT tutor will be to ensure that the quality of the experiences which trainees have is comparable and that assessments are fair, whatever the circumstances. Keeping track of the progress of mentors and the situation in the schools with which you have contact is part of your responsibility. This section explores ways in which this can be achieved.<br><br>

<H1>What is Mentoring and Coaching?</H1>
<BR>
<strong>Introduction</strong><BR>
<BR>
The   definitions for mentoring and coaching vary according to the source consulted.   There are considerable vested interests involved in providing mentoring and   coaching, particularly for large corporate organisations. As a consequence,   there is a lot of research into effective practice in mentoring and coaching &ndash;   though much of it is not of direct relevance to initial teacher training.   However, some of the principles underlying mentoring and coaching are   generalisable, regardless of whether the &lsquo;client&rsquo; is a middle manager in a   multinational company or a trainee ICT teacher in a small urban secondary   school.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>What is the difference between mentoring and a   coaching?</strong><BR>
<BR>
Whilst there is little common agreement, <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em>What is the difference between mentoring and coaching?&hellip;&hellip;there   probably can't be a definitive answer to this. The two terms seem to be   increasingly linked and are often used interchangeably </em><BR>
  The Impact   Factory (n.d.)<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
as we shall see, there is a common pattern   running through the definitions accessed from various   sources.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Mentoring</strong><BR>
<BR>
In terms of mentoring, the common theme   seems to be one of career development:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mentoring is...<em>"off-line help by one person to another in making   significant transitions in knowledge, work or thinking" </em><BR>
  Clutterbuck   &amp; Megginson (2004)<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>Mentoring: helping to shape an individual&rsquo;s   beliefs and values in a positive way; often a longer term career relationship   from someone who has &lsquo;done it before&rsquo; </em><BR>
  Robert Dilts   (2006)<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>Mentoring is the broader of the two concepts. It has a career   progress-oriented dimension with psycho-social development functions,   incorporating counselling and friendship.</em><BR>
  NCSL   (2003)<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>Mentoring: </em>
  <UL>
    <LI><em>is an ongoing relationship that can last for a long period of time </em>
    <LI><em>can be more informal and meetings can take place as and when the mentee   needs some advice, </em>
    <LI><em>guidance or support </em>
    <LI><em>is more long-term and takes a broader view of the person </em>
    <LI><em>has a focus on career and personal development </em></LI>
  </UL>
  <BR>
  The Brefi   Group (n.d.)<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In terms of teacher education and training, the   above suggests that mentoring is a broad, overarching concept which is related   to supporting a trainee in making the significant transition from being a   student teacher (or trainee) to becoming a newly qualified   teacher.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Coaching</strong><BR>
<BR>
Similarly, for coaching another common   theme emerges:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em>Coaching is&hellip;"a process that enables learning and development to   occur and thus performance to improve. "</em><BR>
  Parsloe   (1999)<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>Coaching: helping another person to improve awareness, to set   and achieve goals in order to improve a particular behavioural   performance.</em><BR>
  Robert Dilts (2006)<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>Coaching tends to be seen as   an aspect of mentoring: a more narrow focus relating to an individual&rsquo;s   job-specific tasks, skills or capabilities </em><BR>
  NCSL   (2003)<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>Coaching </em>
  <UL>
    <LI><em>Relationship generally has a set duration </em>
    <LI><em>Short-term (sometimes time-bounded) and focused on specific development   areas/issues </em>
    <LI><em>Focus is generally on development/issues at work </em>
    <LI><em>The agenda is focused on achieving specific, immediate goals </em>
    <LI><em>Coaching revolves more around specific development   areas/issues</em></LI>
  </UL>
  <BR>
  The Brefi Group<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Which suggests   that coaching is more specifically focused on helping a trainee to develop   specific skills and competences.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Mentoring and Coaching for Initial   Teacher Training<BR>
<BR>
<em>Roles and responsibilities</em></strong><BR>
The specific   titles for those engaged in partnership arrangements for Initial Teacher   Training (ITT) vary across providers and sometimes across different programmes   in the same institution. However, regardless of the nomenclature, the roles and   responsibilities will inevitably be very similar:<BR>
<BR>
<em>Associate Teacher /   Student Teacher / Trainee / Mentee / Coachee</em><BR>
Some ITT providers strive to   avoid using the term &lsquo;trainee&rsquo; as it implies a skills-based vocational approach   rather than a collegial model of professional development. As will be seen in   the <A href="text_only7e00.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=3">skills   section</A>, it can be argued that it is equally as important for those being   mentored and coached to receive training in their roles and responsibilities as   it is for those providing the mentoring and coaching. As can be seen, this is   largely dependent on whether the provider regards the mentoring process as one   of apprenticeship or reflective practice (See <A href="text_only1aca.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=6">Background   information</A>). To avoid confusion, those who are training to become teachers   will be referred to throughout this resource as   student-teachers.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Classroom Mentor / Teacher Mentor / Subject   Mentor</em><BR>
In effect, this role is fulfilled by the teacher or teachers who   work alongside the student-teacher in the classroom on an everyday basis. In   some schools or settings, the teacher-mentor will be primarily responsible for   mentoring and coaching the student-teacher, with occasional support from the   professional mentor or university mentor. However, in some schools, regular   formal observations and target setting sessions are provided by the professional   mentor in liaison with the teacher mentor. Very rarely now, will the lead for   mentoring a student-teacher be taken by the university   mentor.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Senior/Lead/Co-ordinating/Professional mentor</em><BR>
Most   schools in partnership with HEI providers will be expected to appoint a mentor   to oversee mentoring within the school. In some cases, a lead mentor may have   responsibility for co-ordinating mentoring across a cluster of schools. It would   be expected that the professional mentor will become involved in supporting the   development of mentoring and coaching within the school or   cluster.<BR>
<BR>
<em>University tutor/mentor</em><BR>
Dependent on the partnership   arrangements under which the provider and schools operate, the university   tutor&rsquo;s role will vary. In some cases, the University Tutor will act in the full   capacity as a mentor, observing students&rsquo; practice, providing feedback and   setting targets. At the other extreme, the university tutor may have little   contact with the trainees in a school and will work more with the school-based   mentors, checking on general progress, quality assuring, moderating assessments   and providing support and training for mentors.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Link Tutor</em><BR>
Some   providers identify tutors with responsibility for liaising with a cluster of   schools. This role differs from that of the University Tutor, for example, some   HEI providers devolve responsibility for arranging placements and the quality   assurance of the training to Link Tutors.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Partnership/Placement   tutor/coordinator/manager</em><BR>
Most HEI providers have at least one designated   member of staff with responsibility for managing and co-ordinating placements   and partnership arrangements with school and settings. In some cases, this   person will have a full-time commitment to this process whilst in others the   tutor concerned will also have a teaching   commitment.<BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
Given   the definitions for mentor and coach, it could be argued that a subject mentor   in a school might well be a coach primarily who occasionally steps into the role   of a mentor. Whereas, a co-ordinating or professional mentor (and indeed the   University Tutor) is more likely to be, first and foremost, a mentor who   occasionally steps into the role of coach.<BR>
<BR>
In 1997, The Centre for the   Use of Research and Evidence in Education (CUREE) was sponsored by the DfES, the   GTC, The National Strategies, NCSL, the QCA and the TDA to produce a <A href="external.html?link=http://www.curee-paccts.com/resources/publications/national-framework-mentoring-and-coaching" target="blank">national framework for mentoring and coaching</A> which would be   relevant to teacher training. Although the framework&rsquo;s focus is principally on   the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) of teachers, it has some resonance   with Initial Teacher Training (ITT).<BR>
<BR>
A feature of this document is that   it aims to clarify the relationship between the coach and the mentor and   attempts to overcome some of the issues associated with the corporate or   commercial view of coaching, which argues that the skills of the coach are   independent of the profession to which it is being applied. In other words,   anyone can coach another. The CUREE Framework therefore identifies the roles as <em>&lsquo;mentor&rsquo;, &lsquo;specialist coach&rsquo; </em>and <em>&lsquo;co-coach&rsquo;</em>. This latter role   covers situations where two teachers or trainees may be working alongside and   supporting each other.<BR>
<BR>
The CUREE framework (1997) will underpin much of   the material in this resource. This is to avoid confusion when outlining terms   and also to provide you with a common reference point. At times, however, where   the framework lacks specificity or where alternative viewpoints are more   relevant, other sources will be used.<BR>

<H1>The Skills of Mentoring and Coaching</H1>
<BR>
So what is involved in being a   mentor and/or a specialist coach? If the aim of teacher training is to allow   each trainee to maximise their potential as a teacher, how can we ensure that   those working with trainees in school are employing effective   strategies?<BR>
<BR>
This resource uses the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.curee-paccts.com/mentoring-and-coaching/national-framework-and-resources" target="blank">National Framework for Mentoring and Coaching</A> as the basis for   its definitions of mentoring and coaching. As can be seen <A href="text_only7d74.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=2">what   constitutes mentoring and coaching</A> is the focus for much debate. The   National Framework was developed by CUREE and has been accepted by many of the   national organisations concerned with education (ie the DfEE, the TDA, the NCSL,   the QCA and the National Strategies).<BR>
<BR>
The National Framework identifies   the following skills for mentoring:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><strong><em>Mentors:</strong><BR>
  1. relate sensitively to learners and work   through agreed processes to build trust and confidence<BR>
  2. model expertise in   practice or through conversation<BR>
  3. relate guidance to evidence from practice   and research<BR>
  4. broker access to a range of opportunities to address the   different goals of the professional learner<BR>
  5. observe, analyse and reflect   upon professional practice and make this explicit<BR>
  6. provide information and   feedback that enables learning from mistakes and success<BR>
  7. build a learner&rsquo;s   control over their professional learning<BR>
  8. use open questions to raise   awareness, explore beliefs, develop plans, understand consequences and explore   and commit to solutions<BR>
  9. listen actively:<BR>
  &bull; accommodating and valuing   silence<BR>
  &bull; concentrating on what&rsquo;s actually being said<BR>
  &bull; using affirming   body language to signal attention<BR>
  &bull; replaying what&rsquo;s been said using some of   the same words to reinforce, value and reframe thinking<BR>
  10. relate practice   to assessment and accreditation frameworks<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Similarly, the   framework details the skills needed for effective 'specialist coaching':<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em><strong>Specialist coaches</strong><BR>
  1. relate sensitively to learners   and work through agreed processes to build trust and confidence<BR>
  2. model   expertise in practice or through conversation<BR>
  3. facilitate access to   research and evidence to support the development of pedagogic practice<BR>
  4.   tailor activities in partnership with the professional learner<BR>
  5. observe,   analyse and reflect upon the professional learner&rsquo;s practice and make this   explicit<BR>
  6. provide information that enables learning from mistakes and   success<BR>
  7. facilitate growing independence in professional learning from the   outset<BR>
  8. use open questions to raise awareness, explore beliefs, encourage   professional learners to arrive at their own plans, understand consequences and   develop solutions<BR>
  9. listen actively:<BR>
  &bull; accommodating and valuing   silence<BR>
  &bull; concentrating on what&rsquo;s actually being said<BR>
  &bull; using affirming   body language to signal attention<BR>
  &bull; replaying what&rsquo;s been said using the same   words to reinforce, value and develop thinking<BR>
  10. establish buffer zones   between coaching and other formal relationships</em><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
As can be   seen, there is considerable overlap between the two sets of skills. These can   therefore be sorted into three categories: those specific to mentoring, those   specific to specialist coaching and those common to both.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Skills   common to mentoring and coaching</strong><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. relating sensitively to learners and work through agreed   processes to build trust and confidence<BR>
  2. modelling expertise in practice or   through conversation<BR>
  5. observing, analysing and reflecting upon professional   practice and make this explicit<BR>
  6. providing information that enables   learning from mistakes and success<BR>
  8. using open questions to raise   awareness, explore beliefs, develop plans and understand consequences<BR>
  9.   listening actively:<BR>
  &bull; accommodating and valuing silence<BR>
  &bull; concentrating on   what&rsquo;s actually being said<BR>
  &bull; using affirming body language to signal   attention<BR>
  &bull; replaying what&rsquo;s been said using some of the same words to   reinforce and value thinking<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Let&rsquo;s unpack and explore each of   these areas of skill:<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Relating sensitively to learners and work   through agreed processes to build trust and confidence</em></strong><BR>
Much of this   centres on the relationship which the mentor or coach forms with the   student-teacher (and vice versa). A key issue here is to ensure that the   participants are well informed about the &lsquo;agreed processes&rsquo;. Making sure   trainees are briefed about the expectations we have for them on placement,   checking they are properly prepared, that the documentation they will be using   and the formats they will have for the presentation of evidence in their   teaching files and professional files or logs is part of this process.   Similarly, it is important that mentors are provided with the information they   need to fulfil their role. Although <A href="text_onlyf01b.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=4">mentor   training and professional development</A> is a key part of this process, taking   care that they receive documentation and have ready access to the resources they   need is part of your responsibility as the University/Link Tutor. <BR>
<BR>
Further to this, school-based mentors may need to be alerted to specific   issues relating to the student-teacher which might affect their progress or the   relationship between mentor and student. For example, there may have been issues   arising from a previous placement which have affected a student's   self-confidence or self-image. Clearly such information will need to be   communicated sensitively to ensure the mentor's judgements and assessments are   not compromised. However, you will need to make the decision that in some cases,   forewarned is forearmed. <BR>
<BR>
Background literature developing aspects of the   formation, development, monitoring and maintenance of professional relationships   include:<BR>
&bull; Abell et al. (1995) - The role of the mentor<BR>
&bull; Kay and Hinds   (2005) - Developing a relationship<BR>
&bull; Egan (2002) - A counselling   approach<BR>
&bull; Goleman (1998) - Emotional Intelligence / competence <BR>
Refer to   the <A href="text_only1aca.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=6">Background   Information section</A> for more detail<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Modelling expertise in   practice or through conversation</em></strong><BR>
This is likely to be more   appropriate for the teacher/subject mentors who will be working more closely   with the student-teacher on a daily basis. However, arrangements could be made   for student- teachers to observe teachers who are not working directly with them   &ndash; for example, in another department or even in another school, particularly   with examples of excellent practice in a particular field or where a teacher has   a particular approach to, say, behaviour management which might be of benefit.   Opportunities could also be provided for student-teachers to observe others&rsquo;   practice through video or webcam.<BR>
<BR>
Research suggests that modelling is   most effective when a clear focus has been identified for the observer prior to   the observation of practice. When a need for modelling has arisen as part of   target setting or action planning, then the types of behaviour, strategies or   techniques can be discussed and unpacked beforehand.<BR>
<BR>
General background   information on modelling can be drawn from:<BR>
&bull; Cruess, Cruess &amp; Steinert   (2008) - Role Modelling <BR>
&bull; UKCLE (n.d.) - Reflection on and in   practice<BR>
Refer to the <A href="text_only1aca.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=6">Background   Information section</A> for more detail<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Observing, analysing and   reflecting</em></strong><BR>
As indicated above, observation of practice is more   effective when the observer has an agenda or has been briefed on a particular   focus for the observation. The same is equally applicable for mentors as for   student-teachers. A pre-observation discussion is valuable in providing an   opportunity to discuss the background and purposes to the activity being   observed, to negotiate agreed focuses and to ensure that opportunities are not   missed.<BR>
<BR>
There is considerable debate as to who benefits most from   analysing and reflecting in a mentoring/coaching relationship. Those who favour   competency-based approaches to mentoring would suggest that it is the role of   the mentor to analyse the mentee&rsquo;s practice and provide feedback (against   pre-defined competencies). This accords with a Standards-based approach to   teacher-training which requires mentors to assess &lsquo;trainees&rsquo; progress in   relation to a set of nationally-defined criteria. However, as can be seen in the <A href="text_only7d74.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=2">&lsquo;What   is mentoring and coaching&rsquo;</A> section of this resource, coaching is often   regarded to be a subskill of mentoring. Hence, a mentor will, at times, become a   coach when identifying specific aspects of practice in need of development and   providing specific targeted support. Many models of coaching adopt a more   reflective, even reflexive, stance &ndash; in which coaches encourage coachees to   reflect on their practice, to analyse for themselves their strengths and areas   for improvement. The aim here is to encourage the student-teacher to become more   independent, self-aware and resourceful in developing his or her practice. <BR>
<BR>
Observation of practice can be provided through video. Some providers   have issued their student-teachers with portable technology to enable them to   record their own practices for later reflection and analysis whilst others have   set up webcams for video streaming between school and university. Issues such as   permissions, confidentiality and data protection must be considered before these   strategies are considered, however.<BR>
<BR>
More information of models of   mentoring and coaching are provided in the <A href="text_only1aca.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=6">Background   Information section</A>. A few key aspects related to this field include:<BR>
&bull;   Brill, Kim &amp; Galloway (2001) - Cognitive Apprenticeship<BR>
&bull; Hoffman-Kipp,   Artiles &amp; Lopez-Torres (2003) The Reflective Practice<BR>
&bull; Lave. &amp;   Wenger (1991) Situated Cognition<BR>
&bull; McNally et al (2004) Informal   Learning<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Providing information</strong><BR>
The ways in which   information is provided by mentors and coaches for student-teachers is, of   course, dependent on the circumstances. Many schools provide a welcome or   briefing pack for student-teachers, often based on a staff handbook. The   content, format, structure and presentation of these will vary from school to   school, but this contents list may be useful if you are wishing to induct a new   school or review existing handbooks. Formal information about the policies and   practices of the school and/or department might be available in documentation   and student-teachers should be encouraged to access these, particularly those   relating to the school&rsquo;s behaviour management procedures, aspects of health and   safety, inclusion and equality.<BR>
<BR>
It is usually the responsibility of the   ITT provider to supply information about the placement; its structure, focus,   expectations, processes and procedures, assessment arrangements and roles and   responsibilities. This is most often provided in paper-based format for ease of   access and use, but some providers are making increasing use of web-based   portals for the dissemination of information and documentation &ndash; even if just   for back-up.<BR>
<BR>
The provision of more specific information relating to the   placement and the student-teacher&rsquo;s roles, responsibilities and timetabling   commitments tend to lie more with the teacher-mentor. Similarly, the   responsibilities for managing more specific day-to-day information about the   student-teacher&rsquo;s progress (eg team-planning, feedback, target-setting,   reflections, and action planning) need to be clarified.<BR>
<BR>
All the above,   enable the student-teachers to gain a clear picture of their progress &ndash; the   procedures they should be following, the expectations for their practices and   the information about their ongoing performance.<BR>
<BR>
For more information on   raising awareness of roles and responsibilities, see the <A href="text_onlyf01b.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=4">section   on training, professional development and support for   mentors</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Using open questions</em></strong><BR>
Questioning techniques   have been shown to be highly effective in learning and teaching situations &ndash; to   encourage the learners to draw upon their own understanding in framing a   response. The majority of coaching and mentoring approaches also stress the   importance of effective questioning, for similar reasons. Ideally,   student-teachers should be identifying and formulating their own responses to   the issues which arise from their practice and hence the role of the mentor and   coach should be to encourage them to develop the awareness needed to reflect on   their own practices. Often it will be necessary, and more cost-effective in   terms of effort, for the mentor/coach to make a limited number of specific   suggestions or recommendations for action, particularly during the early stages   of the student-teacher&rsquo;s practice &ndash; particularly where issues of health and   safety are concerned. But even then, probing the student-teacher&rsquo;s viewpoint   prior to giving a response may reveal that he or she is already aware of the   issue.<BR>
<BR>
A further benefit of effective questioning as an approach for   mentoring and coaching is that it models good practice for classroom teaching,   particularly if the student-teacher&rsquo;s attention is drawn to the methods and   strategies being used.<BR>
<BR>

<strong><em>Listening   actively</strong><BR>
Active Listening is a well-documented technique which is   employed in a range of fields from counselling, through mentoring and coaching   to personalised learning. It involves the listener in continually probing,   seeking clarification, testing ideas, summarising and giving feedback to ensure   that the information which is being received is congruent with what was   transmitted. It is particularly valuable when coaching a student teacher,   especially when seeking to ascertain the student&rsquo;s view of a situation or event.   Combined with effective questioning, the coach can often learn as much,   sometimes more, about a learning event than the coachee. Increasingly, with the   increased focused on personalisation, &lsquo;learning conversations&rsquo; are being used   with children to check on their progress and understandings. The techniques are   broadly similar.<BR>

<BR>
<strong>Skills specific to   mentoring</strong><BR>
As we have seen in the section on <A href="text_only7d74.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=2">'What   is Mentoring and Coaching'</A>, the role of the mentor is considered to be more   global than that of the coach. The mentor is expected to support the mentee   through a significant career transition and could be involved in making an   assessment or appraisal of performance. In terms of supporting student-teachers   in developing practice and more specifically in meeting the required Standards   for QTS, the following additional skills are required.<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Relate   guidance to evidence</strong><BR>
A key factor in supporting student-teachers is   helping to ensure they are not only addressing the Standards for QTS but are   providing evidence of their performance. Providers will vary as to how this   information is accumulated but most provide some sort of mapping system for   relating evidence to the requirements. This may sometimes be accompanied by a   portfolio (or e-Portfolio) in which evidence is compiled. Mentors have a role in   guiding student teachers in identifying the types of evidence which are   appropriate, monitoring the evidence-gathering and assessing the relevance,   quality and range of the evidence provided. Mentors also have responsibility for   ensuring they are accumulating clear evidence of the student- teachers&rsquo;   performance in relation to the requirements, particularly when justifying their   assessments through moderation.<BR>
<BR>
As can be seen in the <A href="text_only2938.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=5">section   on Quality Assurance</A>, ensuring that robust and reliable evidence is being   accumulated by student-teachers and mentors is a prime concern. This is not only   to ensure that decisions on pass/fail or grades are equitable and fair, but also   to ensure that if there are disputes, the decisions reached are accountable and   verifiable.<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Broker access to a range of   opportunities</strong><BR>
Whereas a coach tends to work one-to-one with a coachee   on a particular focused aspect of practice, a mentor may decide to arrange   additional opportunities for a mentee to gain experience. For example, this may   be through the observation of a leading practitioner, discussions with a   specialist (eg a SENCo), participation in staff development or collaborative   planning sessions, involvement in parents&rsquo; meetings or school events, visits to   neighbouring schools (eg a feeder primary school), etc.<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Provide   feedback / Relate practice to assessment</strong><BR>
Feedback can be provided at   various stages in a placement. The sort of feedback which is likely to be   provided immediately following an observation of a lesson or activity is more   likely to be reflective and developmental, employing the techniques of effective   questioning and active listening. In terms of mentoring, feedback is more likely   to be focused on the extent of the student-teacher&rsquo;s progress in meeting aspects   of the Standards. It might, therefore, be summative as well as formative. As   indicated above, assessments of practice are more convincing and robust when   related to evidence &ndash; indeed, it could be argued that assessments must be based   on evidence. This is particularly important when dealing with student-teachers   whose progress is causing concern as the focus will be on the aspects of   practice which need attention rather than the characteristics of the individual   concerned (see below).<BR>
<BR>

&bull; Whitmore (2002) - The GROW model of coaching<BR>
Refer to the <A href="text_only1aca.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=6">Background   Information section</A> for more detail<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Target-setting and action   planning</em></strong><BR>
A significant omission from the Coaching and Mentoring   Framework is target setting and action planning. In terms of guiding a   student-teacher in meeting the requirements laid out in the Standards for QTS,   having a series of clear, achievable goals is an essential part of the process   of review and forward planning.<BR>
<BR>
Most will be familiar with the acronym   for setting SMART targets:<BR>
&bull; Specific, Measurable, Agreed, Realistic, Time   phased<BR>
Whitmore (2002) also suggests targets should be PURE:<BR>
&bull; Positively   stated, Understood, Relevant, Ethical) <BR>
and CLEAR:<BR>
&bull; Challenging, Legal,   Environmentally sound, Appropriate, Recorded<BR>
<BR>
The processes for setting   targets and action planning and the procedures for recording, monitoring and   reviewing progress against targets and actions varies in detail between   providers but the products are largely similar. In some cases, targets are set   following an observation of practice, whilst other providers prefer to discuss   target setting at regular (eg weekly) review meetings. Action planning tends to   be more long-term or, in some cases, arising from a &lsquo;cause for concern&rsquo;   procedure.<BR>
<BR>
The process by which goals or targets are identified,   negotiated, discussed and agreed will vary, not only between providers but   across mentors within a single partnership. This will be dependent on the   relationship between the mentor and mentee and the stage the mentoring   relationship has reached (See below). For example, a student-teacher with little   previous experience of teaching at the start of his first placement may have   difficulty identifying and setting his own targets, whereas it is to be hoped   that a confident student-teacher towards the end of a final placement will be   considerably more proactive in setting her own targets.<BR>
<BR>
For more   information on developing mentors&rsquo; and student-teachers&rsquo; skills in target   setting refer to <A href="text_onlyf01b.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=4">the   section on mentor training and professional development</A>.

<BR>
<strong><em>Building a   learner&rsquo;s control</strong><BR>
As indicated in the subsection above, a key   objective for a mentor is to develop the mentoring relationship from one of   dependence on the part of the mentee to independence, by shifting the locus of   control from mentor to mentee. It is very important that training providers have   a clear appreciation of the background of each student-teacher from the moment   he or she enters the course, to ensure that the right sort and level of support   is provided and that those involved in school-based training are aware of this.   Many ITT programmes have comprehensive strategies for identifying the training   needs of their students and, through a training plan, personalise training   activities and the focus of school-based experience to meet those needs. <BR>
<BR>
As student-teachers become more experienced and confident, their needs   will change, and hence the training plan will have to be continuously reviewed,   modified and adapted. You may find it useful to refer to some of the models of   the mentoring relationship to help identify and monitor the progress of your   students through the programme.<BR>
<BR>
Models of mentoring and coaching identify   stages through which a mentoring relationship progresses. For example:<BR>
&bull;   Technical, practical, critical, emancipatory (Furlong, J., Hirst, P. H.,   Pocklington, K. &amp; Miles, S. (1988))<BR>
&bull; formal, cordial, friendship   (Martin, S. (1994)) <BR>
&bull; early idealism, survival, recognising difficulties,   hitting the plateau, moving on (Maynard, T., Furlong, J. (1993)) <BR>
&bull; Mutual   Admiration, Development, Disillusionment, Parting, Transformation   (Phillips-Jones, L. (n.d.))<BR>
Refer to the <A href="text_only1aca.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=6">Background   Information section</A> for more detail<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of the labels, these   models suggest an effective mentoring relationship is one which shifts over   time. However, the omnipresence of assessment against the Standards means that a   key element of control remains in the hands of the mentor. The introduction of   grade criteria (OFSTED, 2008) which go beyond the Standards by adopting a &lsquo;best   fit&rsquo; approach adds a further level of complication to the assessment process but   does seem to be an attempt to move away from the &lsquo;box-ticking&rsquo; competency   approach to mentoring to one which lends itself more to a reflective,   learner-centred   model.<BR>
<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Skills   specific to specialist coaching</strong><BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Facilitate access to research   and evidence to support the development of pedagogic practice</em></strong><BR>
In   HEI-based ITT it is assumed that the HEI will provide student-teachers with   access to research and, for example, inspection evidence to support the   development of their practice. With the vast majority of PGCE programmes now   being assessed at Masters Level, it is hard to imagine that student-teachers   would not be expected to draw extensively on research to analyse, evaluate and   reflect upon key aspects of practice. The impending introduction of the   school-based <A href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/leaders/teachers/mtl.aspx" target="blank">Masters in Teaching and Learning</A> could impact on where and how   student-teachers will gain access to research evidence, particularly those   following school-based training routes into teaching. <BR>
<BR>
The extent to   which school-based mentors have access to and utilise research evidence in   carrying out their role will be dependent on the training and ongoing support   they receive from their provider(s) and also their motivations, interests and   background. (See <A href="text_onlyf01b.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=4">Training   and Development Section</A>)<BR>
<BR>
It has been argued, particularly by <A href="external.html?link=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_learning" target="blank">Argyris and Sch&ouml;n (1974, 1976, 1993)</A>, that professionals   develop &lsquo;theories of action&rsquo; and &lsquo;theories-in-use&rsquo; which inform and help to   rationalise and develop their practices. The notions of &lsquo;single- and double-loop   learning&rsquo;, &lsquo;reflection-on, reflection-in and reflection-through-action&rsquo; (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-schon.htm" target="blank">Sch&ouml;n, 1983</A>) are powerful in helping both coach and coachee to   make their implicit and developing theories more explicit and hence susceptible   to scrutiny, testing and challenge.<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Tailor activities in   partnership with the professional learner</em></strong><BR>
A key task of the   teacher-mentor, in collaboration with the student-teacher, professional-mentor   and university-tutor, is to manage the day-to-day activities which will enable   student-teachers to develop their skills, knowledge and expertise. These   activities can arise formally through negotiated target-setting and action   planning or less formally as issues and opportunities   arise.<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Facilitate growing independence in professional learning   from the outset</em></strong><BR>
As indicated in the mentoring section above (see   Build a learner&rsquo;s control), having an awareness of the stages through which the   coaching relationship is developing will help the coach gradually shift   responsibility for target setting and action planning to the coachee. <BR>
<BR>
Whitmore (2002), for example, outlines the GROW model which stresses the   importance from the outset of a coachee&rsquo;s &lsquo;awareness and responsibility&rsquo; for the   actions which are agreed and taken in a coaching relationship. <BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Establish buffer zones between coaching and other formal   relationships</em></strong><BR>
As a university tutor you will become increasingly   aware of the range of coaching and mentoring relationships which develop between   teacher-mentors, professional-mentors and student teachers. Sometimes there will   be clashes of personality which impinge upon the coaching relationship and   occasionally informal aspects of the relationship affect the objectivity of the   judgements which are being made &ndash; ie the coach and the coachee become &lsquo;too   pally&rsquo;.<BR>
<BR>
Helping school-based mentors to be aware of the conflicts in role   between being a colleague, an assessor and a friend is an important part of the   training process (see <A href="text_onlyf01b.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=4">Training   and Professional Development</A>) as is the importance of basing judgements on   evidence (see above).<BR>

<H1>Training and Professional Development in Mentoring and Coaching</H1>
<BR>
This   section provides you with some ideas and resources for inducting and developing   the expertise of mentors with whom you will be working. Training for mentors can   be provided through formal, centre-based training sessions or through one-to-one   school-based contact. Included in this section are examples of activities and   resources which might prove useful in clarifying your role in training and   supporting mentors with whom you are working.<BR>
<BR>
The type and focus of the   training you provide will be dependent on a number of interrelated factors: the   particular role of the recipients, their background experience of teaching,   their existing knowledge and experience of mentoring and coaching, the   partnership arrangements, your role, the nature and purpose of the training and   the location of and circumstances determining the training. For example,   training could take place on a one-to-one basis with a mentor during a   school-visit; alternatively, the training may take place as part of a one-day   conference for all types of mentor across the whole partnership. Similarly, the   training could be provided online, through the provision of documentation and   resources, via the student-teachers or through university-tutors.<BR>
<BR>
Some of   the strategies and approaches you may want to consider in providing support for   your mentors might include:<BR>
&bull; One-to-one ongoing support via university   tutors and/or link tutors<BR>
&bull; One-to-one support for teacher-mentors provided   by professional mentors<BR>
&bull; Cascade training provided to link tutors and/or   professional mentors which is then disseminated to teacher-mentors<BR>
&bull; Training   manuals, booklets, leaflets and documentation for consultation on a need-to-know   basis<BR>
&bull; Online activities, materials and resources for mentors<BR>
&bull; Online   discussion-boards, blogs and FAQs to address ongoing needs<BR>
&bull; Cluster-based   training sessions for mentors with a common interest<BR>
&bull; Centre-based induction   and update sessions for target groups of mentors<BR>
&bull; Centre-based &lsquo;training&rsquo;   sessions for specific groups of mentors<BR>
&bull; Centre-based conferences to address   identified needs or particular initiatives<BR>
&bull; Local or regional conferences   and briefings<BR>
<BR>
Rather than attempting to anticipate the range of   approaches which you may decide to adopt, this section will focus on the   purposes of the training, leaving you to determine the most appropriate means by   which the training and development is delivered.<BR>
<BR>
The model of training   and development which is proposed here draws upon several sources and is based   on experience across a range of providers. It aims to address the skills and   knowledge needed for effective mentoring and coaching in an ITT setting by   organising training activities according to the needs of the   recipients.<BR>

<em>Intended   audience</em></strong><BR>
As can be seen from the other sections of this resource   (What is menotoring and coaching?|199|2#), it is assumed that mentoring is more   likely to be the primary focus of the university tutor and professional mentor,   in managing, assessing and monitoring the training process. However,   teacher-mentors will need to be aware of some of the issues included here,   particularly those relating to the assessment and target   setting.<BR>

<em>Intended   audience</em><BR>
Although teacher-mentors are those most likely to be engaged   in coaching student-teachers, mentors too will be expected to coach   student-teachers from time to time and will almost certainly be involved in   coaching teacher-mentors. It is also important that the coachees are provided   with training in their role in the coaching relationship. A powerful way of   achieving this is to plan training activities which involve both the mentors and   the student-teachers working together.<BR>

<BR>
<strong>Training   activities and resources</strong><BR>
What follows is a selective overview of the   types of activity which could be used in supporting and developing the   capabilities of the mentors for whom you have responsibility. This is by no   means an exhaustive list, but may provide some   ideas.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Scenarios</em><BR>
Scenario-based approaches provide   opportunities for mentors to reflect on their own experiences or devise   strategies for dealing with situations which have so far been outside their own   experience. For example, a scenario might focus on a student-teacher who is not   making expected progress despite having been set clear targets.<BR>
<BR>
Scenarios   can be presented through thumbnail descriptions of situations, through audio   recordings of say a feedback session, through transcripts of a target-setting   session, through video recordings of actual or staged sessions or through role   play.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Summary cards</em><BR>
An extension of the above could be   to supply the participants with a series of cards which attempt to summarise the   key issues arising from the scenario. The cards should be of varying relevance,   with some being highly significant and others being irrelevant. The participants   sort the cards according to significance. For example, cards could be provided   showing the Standards. The participants are asked to identify which of the   Standards is most applicable to the   situation.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Perspectives/spectacles analysis</em><BR>
An   interesting variation on the above is for participants to try and see the issues   arising from a scenario or an incident from another&rsquo;s perspective &ndash; for example   the student-teacher&rsquo;s, the children&rsquo;s, the head of department&rsquo;s, the university   tutor&rsquo;s, the professional mentor&rsquo;s, an OFSTED inspector&rsquo;s, etc.. For those   wishing to take this further, participants could be asked to view a situation   from the perspective of an educationist such as Vygotsky, Bandura, Bruner, Sch&ouml;n   or Moon. <BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Modelling and role play</em><BR>
Similar to scenarios,   a group of participants is asked to work through a situation (eg giving feedback   following a particularly difficult lesson) and the other participants are asked   to act as observers, recording examples of, for example, active listening,   effective questioning or negotiated target setting.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Sorting or   classifying activities</em><BR>
Participants are provided with cards or   post-its of concepts, statements, descriptions or outlines of events and asked   to sort them into order of priority, seriousness, relevance or difficulty.   Alternatively, the cards could be sorted into categories either defined by the   organiser or on the basis of an emergent classification system. For example, a   series of tasks could be sorted by participants according to who they consider   should take responsibility for their completion.<BR>
<BR>
A variation of the above   is to ask the participants to create their own cards or post-its of, say, issues   which are concerning them, and sort these into priority order or group them into   clusters.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Concept mapping</em><BR>
Participants brainstorm their   understanding of an aspect of mentoring and coaching (eg giving feedback) and,   using post-it notes, link the ideas together in the form of a concept-map. This   provides the trainer with a useful overview of the participants&rsquo; current state   of knowledge and understanding and allows participants to share their knowledge   with the rest of the group.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>SWOT/GAP   analysis</em><BR>
Participants are asked to identify the strengths,   weaknesses, opportunities and threats to partnership arrangements within their   own schools and/or across the partnership. Whilst this might prove to be   uncomfortable for you as the organiser, the next stage will be for the   participants to generate ways forward to make enhancements. This process   sometimes reveals that the issues require some sharing of   responsibility.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Generating solutions</em><BR>
Groups of   participants are presented with problems which might arise as part of their role   as mentor, coach, tutor or student-teacher. They must then generate as many   solutions (or responses) as they can within an allotted time. They should be   encouraged to consider a full range of solutions, including those which are not   feasible as sometimes these can lead to novel solutions.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Buzz   Groups</em><BR>
Small groups of participants are asked to discuss a particular   issue and then feed back to the group as a whole their thoughts. The issues   could be common to all groups, related issues or diverse issues. For example, a   real issue might be the communication of information across the partnership. The   buzz groups could be used to suggest ways in which communication could be   improved; one group focusing on documentation, another group on web-based   resources and a third group on communication through individuals such as the   student-teachers and link tutors.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Moderation activities and   events</em><BR>
Participants bring evidence of student-teachers&rsquo; planning,   reflections, action-planning to a group session to compare their   assessments.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Paired observations</em><BR>
An effective way of   developing practice is to arrange paired observations of student-teachers&rsquo;   practice. The participants make independent records of their observations and   compare notes subsequently, noting similarities and differences in their   practices and outcomes. Paired observation sessions can be staged in   university-based training sessions through the use of   video.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Co-coaching</em><BR>
Mentors and coaches work together on   developing an aspect of their practice which is of mutual concern. The   participants agree beforehand the objectives and strategies for enhancing their   practice and then monitor each other (eg through observation of a feedback   session with a student-teacher) to develop aspects of their practice. It has   been shown that both observer and observed benefit greatly from such   experiences.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Learning logs and diaries</em><BR>
Just as   student-teachers are expected to complete learning logs of their progress,   mentors could also keep logs of their experiences, particularly events or   incidents which are particularly significant. These could be shared on a   one-to-one basis with professional mentors, university tutors or link tutors for   reflection or analysis or could be used as the basis for a group-based session   (suitably anonymised).<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Peer tutoring / peer   explaining</em><BR>
Prior to a training session, participants could be asked   to explore a particular aspect of their role and present a summary of their   findings to the group. For example, one participant might be asked to find out   about the GROW model of coaching whilst another is asked to study Egan&rsquo;s   &lsquo;skilled helper&rsquo; approach. The group could then discuss the relevance of these   models for their own practice.<BR>
<BR>
<em><strong>Swapshop</em><BR>
Each participant   is asked to describe an aspect of their practice in working as a mentor which   they feel is particularly effective. These are collated and discussed. To make   this feel less intimidating, this could be done in small groups to later be   shared with the whole cohort.<BR>

<H1>The Quality Assurance of School-based Provision</H1>
<BR>
Two sections of the   ICT Tutors website deal with aspects of quality assurance within the university   based components ITT programmes (<A href="text_only433f.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=11&ts=1">Quality   Assurance</A> and <A href="text_only70fa.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=6&tp=0&ts=1">Delivering   High Quality Training</A>), this section is about quality assurance of your   school-based provision.<BR>
<BR>
The OFSTED framework for the inspection of   Initial Teacher Training is a useful starting point when evaluating the quality   of your school-based provision. - <A href="external.html?link=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Forms-and-guidance/Browse-all-by/Other/General/Framework-for-the-inspection-of-initial-teacher-education-2008-11" target="blank">http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Forms-and-guidance/Browse-all-by/Other/General/Framework-fo<BR>
r-the-inspection-of-initial-teacher-education-2008-11</A><BR>
<BR>
Similarly,   you need and your mentors need to be very familiar with the OFSTED Grade   Criteria to ensure that all judgements of your student-teachers&rsquo; performance   accords with those of the inspectors.<BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Forms-and-guidance/Browse-all-by/Other/General/Grade-criteria-for-the-inspection-of-initial-teacher-education-2008-11" target="blank">http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Forms-and-guidance/Browse-all-by/Other/General/Grade-criter<BR>
ia-for-the-inspection-of-initial-teacher-education-2008-11</A><BR>
<BR>
A   key aspect of the inspection is a judgement on the overall effectiveness of the   provision. OFSTED are principally concerned with the extent to which the   provision is successful in securing high-quality outcomes for all trainees. To   make this judgement they take account of a series of factors.<BR>
<BR>
Whether   available resources are used effectively and efficiently
<UL>
  <LI>how well the available resources are deployed to secure the best possible   outcomes for trainees  
  <LI>how well the provider explains and justifies the allocation of resources in   terms of the outcomes for trainees</LI>
</UL>
This will include the way in which   the funding which is provided for training by the TDA is deployed within the   university and across the partnership schools. The expectation is that the   moneys which are provided to schools for ITT trainees is used to, for example,   facilitate paired observations, meetings with key members of staff, non-contact   time for attendance at mentor training sessions. Part of your QA role will   therefore be to check on how schools are utilising the funds which the   university devolves to them. This is clearly a sensitive area but something into   which OFSTED will enquire.<BR>
<BR>
A further issue which forms part of an OFSTED   inspection is the extent to which the provision across the partnership is of   consistently high quality. Factors to be considered include:
<UL>
  <LI>the extent to which all trainers contribute to the training programme and   the accurate assessments of trainees to secure the best possible outcomes for   individuals and groups of trainees, as evidenced by:  
    <ul>
      <li>how well all those involved in training understand the rationale for the   training programme  
      </li>
      <li>the quality of placements and mentoring support for trainees   
      </li>
      <li>the involvement of all partners in reviewing, planning and delivering the   training programme   
      </li>
      <li>the extent to which all training partners have high expectations for   training and of trainees  
      </li>
      <li>the effectiveness of the professional development of all trainers in   securing and sustaining high-quality training and consistent and reliable   assessments of trainees  
      </li>
      <li>the accuracy of final assessments  
      </li>
      <li>the views of trainees.</li>
  </ul>  
  </LI>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Clearly, this provides a clear agenda for you in   organising your mentor training sessions, ensuring school-based colleagues are   actively involved in monitoring, developing, contributing to and being kept up   to date with changes to the programme.<BR>
<BR>
Another key aspect is the   reliability, accuracy and consistency of assessments of trainees&rsquo; practice.   Ensuring that mentors new to the partnership are provided with adequate training   and ongoing support (e.g. through paired observations and moderation events with   the professional mentor and/or university tutor) is another key element of   quality assurance.<BR>
<BR>
There will be an expectation that you will keep   accurate records of not only each trainee&rsquo;s progress, but also the stage of   training and experience, consistency of support and assessments and the feedback   from trainees for each mentor in the partnership.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, you will be   expected to have regularly and continuously gathered the views and evaluation   data from mentors and trainees, analysed them for patterns and anomalies and put   into effect action plans and strategies for addressing any issues which have   arisen.<BR>
<BR>
Another key element of the inspection will be a judgement on the   extent to which the provision promotes equality of opportunity, values diversity   and eliminates harassment and unlawful discrimination. Inspectors will seek to   determine:
<UL>
  <LI>the views of trainees  
  <LI>how well the partnership ensures that all trainees receive their entitlement   to high-quality training to secure the best possible outcomes  
  <LI>how well the partnership promotes equality of access and opportunity,   eliminates any harassment and unlawful discrimination  
  <LI>how well the partnership creates a harmonious and inclusive environment for   learning through:  
    <ul>
      <li>the quality of support for the personal well-being of individual and groups   of trainees  
      </li>
      <li>how secure trainees feel in declaring a disability and/or personal   circumstance and/or in reporting incidents of harassment and unlawful   discrimination  
      </li>
      <li>how confident trainees are that any declaration will lead to adjustments and   adaptations to training programmes so that equality of access is   secured</li>
    </ul>
  
  </LI>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
There is an expectation that the university will have   made clear to partnership schools its policies for race equality and   discrimination and set in place procedures for trainees to report any issues   which arise. Trainees will also be expected to be made aware of the school&rsquo;s own   policies and procedures safeguarding the wellbeing of the children they will be   teaching.<BR>
<BR>
Inspectors will ask the trainees about their knowledge and   understanding of the policies and procedures and you will be expected to be able   to outline how issues have or will be dealt with should they   arise.<BR>
<BR>
Inspectors will also evaluate how performance is reviewed in order   to improve or to sustain high-quality outcomes. They will explore:
<UL>
  <LI>the extent to which self-evaluation by management:  
  <LI>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI>covers all aspects of the provision (including the Requirements and   legislation for equality and diversity)   
  <LI>is based on reliable evidence, including the views of trainees and other   users such as schools and colleges  
  <LI>has correctly identified any variations in the quality of provision  
  <LI>is incisive, rigorous and accurate  
  <LI>includes the analysis of trainees&rsquo; progress and attainments over time   
  <LI>provides a secure basis to evaluate impact and plan for further   improvements</LI>
  </LI>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>how well the quality of recruitment and selection, training and assessment   of trainees across the partnership is monitored and judged, through:  
  <LI>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI>the analysis of data and other information about trainees&rsquo; progress and   attainment, including that made by particular groups, and, where appropriate,   trainees&rsquo; future career paths  
  <LI>the scrutiny of the impact of the policies on diversity, equal opportunities   and race relations, and the elimination of harassment and unlawful   discrimination  
  <LI>the quality of internal and external moderation of the assessment of   trainees&rsquo; progress and attainment  
  <LI>the extent to which the provider takes account of a wide range of evidence,   including the views of current trainees and training partners, former trainees and their employing   institutions, and other stakeholders, to evaluate the quality of the   training.
  </LI>
  </LI>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
You will probably be asked to explain how you track the   progress of trainees from interview through to the award of the qualification at   the end of the course. You should also have available examples of how you have   acted on concerns over the quality of school-based provision, indicating how   these were identified and the strategies you had in place for dealing with them.   You will need to keep evidence of your monitoring visits to schools, how you   make judgements about the quality of provision in school and how you provide   school-based mentors with feedback on the effectiveness of their support. As   indicated above, how you and/or your professional mentors moderate the   assessments of subject mentors will be scrutinised.<BR>
<BR>
The inspectors will   evaluate how you and your partnership anticipates change, and prepares for and   responds to national and local initiatives. This will include:
<UL>
  <LI>the extent to which the leadership at all levels deals effectively with   change, implements improvement and assesses impact, through:  
  <LI>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI>the effectiveness of planning in anticipating and addressing changes in   policy, and national/local initiatives   
  <LI>the extent to which workforce, partnership and resource planning and   development are effective in preparing to meet the demands created by these   changes  
  <LI>use of systematic and/or innovative and creative approaches: to dealing with   change; longstanding and intractable problems; implementing improvement; and   assessing impact.</LI>
  </LI>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
You should make sure you can explain how you keep your   school-based mentors up-to-date with developments in the ITT programme which   reflect ongoing changes to the curriculum and current initiatives. <BR>
<BR>
Finally, the inspection will explore the extent to which you plan and   take action for improvement. This will cover:
<UL>
  <LI>how well planning builds on clearly identified needs and priorities,   establishes focused and measurable success criteria and allocates resources to   achieve the best outcomes for trainees  
  <LI>the extent to which leadership at all levels has a record of securing   improvement and/or sustaining high-quality outcomes for trainees, as evidenced   by:  
  <LI>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI>the effectiveness of the actions taken to ensure consistently high-quality   training and outcomes across the partnership  
  <LI>the impact of the actions taken to deal with identified shortcomings in   trainees&rsquo; progress and attainments   
  <LI>the effectiveness with which the necessary actions are communicated across   the partnership.</LI>
  </LI>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>You should therefore ensure you have evidence that you   have analysed evaluations, assessment information and trends, not only within   your own programme but also in comparison with the performance of similar   providers and national benchmarks (eg the annual NQT survey). There should   therefore be a clear link between performance data and developments in the   programme to improve provision and/or to address any areas of concern. It will   be expected that developments will have been made with the involvement of   colleagues in school and that all those engaged in partnership will have been   informed about the implications of changes.<BR>
  <BR>
Although the above sounds   quite daunting, most of it is common sense. Just as you will keep clear and   accurate records of the progress of each trainee, you should also ensure you   have QA information about all schools and mentors. Mentor training (whether   university-based, cluster-based or on a one-to-one basis) should provide   opportunities to consult with and keep colleagues abreast of developments. It   makes sense therefore, to log all contact with school-based mentors and ensure   that rigorous systems are in place for gathering and analysing performance   data.</p>

<H1>Background Information on Mentoring and Coaching</H1>
<BR>
What follows is an   attempt to provide a flavour of the issues, themes, underpinning theories and   rationales for mentoring and coaching. You will find that there is a wealth of   information available via the internet as mentoring and coaching for improving   leadership, management, corporate development, business acumen, sporting prowess   and general life skills is big business. Some of this information and approaches   are founded on pseudo-scientific principles, but because the focus of mentoring   and coaching is on personal development, it also touches upon a wide range of   topics ranging from the study of social interaction, through perception, to   learning theories.<BR>
<BR>
The issues presented here are an attempt to provide a   background to the themes presented in the other sections of this resource and   are intended to provide you with a springboard for further   enquiry.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>What is mentoring and coaching?</strong><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The CUREE National Framework for mentoring and coaching has been   endorsed by the NCSL, the DfES, the TDA, the GTC, the QCA and the National   Strategies. It provides a useful overview of the roles and skills required of   mentors, specialist coaches and co-coaches, and forms the background to this   resource. As has been shown however, it does have its limitations:<BR>

  The   National College for School Leadership (NCSL) provides a range of information   and resources supporting mentoring and coaching for leadership within   educational settings. Although not specifically related to ITT, there is also   information on mentoring for personalisation.

<strong>The benefits of mentoring and coaching for   schools and teachers</strong><BR>
When promoting the value for schools of engagement   in mentoring ITT student-teachers, it is sometimes useful to be able to point to   studies which identifies ongoing benefits.
<UL>
  <LI>Bullough (2005) suggests the key benefits of mentoring are: enhancing   confidence, building capacity for overcoming difficulties, increasing morale and   job satisfaction  
  <LI>Cain (2009) argues that the benefits for mentors in making use of research   evidence are that it helps to inform practice; to improve understanding of   mentoring using theoretical frameworks, to learn through vicarious experiences   of mentoring and to discover ways of investigating one&rsquo;s own practice  
  <LI>Hurd, Jones, McNamara &amp; Craig (2007) suggest that engagement by schools   in ITT provide a series of benefits for enhancing their professional practice.   Tier 1 benefits include: access to teaching resources and information on   curriculum developments and new ideas. Tier 2 benefits include: enthused   teachers becoming inspired and motivated to change their classroom practices.   Tier 3 benefits include: value congruence between provider and school with   training-active schools achieving significantly higher test results and higher   Ofsted inspection grades.  
  <LI>McIntyre &amp; Hagger (1996) identify benefits for schools and teachers in   terms of reducing isolation, increasing confidence/self-esteem and improving   self-reflection and problem-solving.</LI>
</UL>
<strong>Mentoring Roles, Skills,   Strategies and Qualities</strong><BR>
This resource has used the CUREE framework for   mentoring and coaching as a basis, largely because it has been recognised and   adopted by most of the organisations involved in teaching and teacher education.   As has been indicated in the <A href="text_only7e00.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=4&ts=3">Skills   section</A>, it does have its limitations. The following annotated bibliography   provides an overview of other sources on which you may wish to draw,   particularly when developing training and development programmes which might   lead to advanced qualifications or classroom-based research.
<UL>
  <LI>Abell et al. (1995) identify a series of roles which mentors of beginning   teachers (ie NQTs) may adopt. These include: parent figure, support system,   trouble shooter, scaffolder, guide, counsellor and role model  
  <LI>Buell (2004) Highlights four common approaches to mentoring; cloning,   nurturing, friendship and apprenticeship   
  <LI>Burgess &amp; Shelton Mayes (2007) stress the importance of mentors   supporting professional development through an apprenticeship approach. They   suggest the role of the mentor includes identifying starting points for   mentoring, mentoring for growth and assessing the mentee.  
  <LI>Feiman-Nemser &amp; Parker (1992) suggest there are three types of mentor:   local guides, educational companions, agents of change &ndash; the latter being the   most effective.  
  <LI>Fletcher (2004) sees the mentor and mentee working together in partnership   with the mentor acting as a co-researcher with the mentee.  
  <LI>Furlong &amp; Maynard (1995) have probably had the greatest influence on the   development of mentoring in teacher education. They suggest mentors act as   models, a coach, mentors, critical friends and a co-enquirers. As a model they   support the student&rsquo;s observations and become involved in collaborative teaching   focused on rules and routines. As a coach they engage in systematic observation   and provide feedback the student&rsquo;s &lsquo;performance&rsquo;. As a mentor they facilitate   reflection &ndash;on &ndash;action. When acting as a critical friend they observe and   re-examine the effectiveness of lesson planning and delivery and as a   co-enquirer they teach and supervise in partnership with the student,   negotiating the focus and working collaboratively on aspects of practice.  
  <LI>Hall et al (2008) point to issues of dual identity with teacher-mentors (ie   teacher v mentor). They suggest that the mentor needs to be prepared to provide   emotional as well as professional support. Mentors need to understand the   implications of university assignment supervision and become involved in   critical evaluation and reflection whilst also developing these skills in the   student. Mentors also need to be prepared to become involved in team teaching   and collaborative planning. The writers argue that an effective mentor possesses   a range of attributes and personal qualities which include: relevant experience,   the ability to offer constructive criticism, the means by which to arrange   teaching opportunities and a willingness to model and demonstrate. The   importance of role clarity is also emphasised as a key characteristic of   success.  
  <LI>Hoad (2007) lists a series of qualities which effective mentors of ITT   students possess. These include; developing mutual trust, being supportive,   modelling teaching, providing induction into the school and classroom, sharing   expert knowledge, building autonomy in the trainee, supporting growth of the   trainee&rsquo;s identity as a teacher, possessing interpersonal skills and having the   ability to be critically reflective.  
  <LI>Kajs (2002) proposes a framework for supporting novice teachers which   includes; knowledge of the stages of teacher development, an appreciation of   adult learning principles, an appreciation of the role of professional   development, skills in assessment, interpersonal skills, and relevant classroom   knowledge and skills.  
  <LI>Kay and Hinds (2005) suggest that the general attributes needed for   effective mentoring include; enthusiasm, commitment, willingness,   approachability, an ability to open doors and relevant experience. They also   suggest that the development of the following skills is beneficial; listening,   motivating, influencing, fact finding, liaising, counselling and time   management.  
  <LI>Marable &amp; Raimondi (2007) have explored what NQTs found to be the most   valuable types of support during their first year of teaching and identify;   observation, feedback, written materials, visibility and contact, ongoing   support on an individual level, clear expectation of roles and responsibilities,   problem resolution, &lsquo;get together&rsquo; with peers, focus groups, networking time and   classroom visits to other schools.  
  <LI>McNally &amp; Martin (1998) identify three types of mentor - Type A   nurturer/supporter, &lsquo;laissez-faire&rsquo; low challenge - Type B, high support, high   challenge, reflective - Type C, authority figure, lacks engagement &ndash; with type B   being seen as the most effective  
  <LI>Mullen and Lick (1999) suggest that mentoring is best when the two parties   work in partnership, creating a synergy.  
  <LI>Rowley (1999) outlines the key characteristics of a &lsquo;Good Mentor&rsquo;. These   include being committed, recognising the role of the beginning teacher,   providing instructional support, being effective with interpersonal skills,   modelling continuous learning, and communicating hope and optimism.  
  <LI>Saunders, Pettinger &amp; Tomlinson (1995) identify four types of mentor:   &lsquo;hands-off&rsquo;, &lsquo;progressively collaborative&rsquo;, &lsquo;professional friend&rsquo;, &lsquo;classical&rsquo;   mentor&rsquo;. They do not favour any particular type, suggesting each has its   benefits and drawbacks.  
  <LI>The Scottish HMIE (2008) set-out a series of skills which are required for   effective mentoring of ITT students which include; observing practice, asking   questions, giving advice, giving feedback, instructing, listening to understand,   making suggestions, offering guidance, paraphrasing, reflecting, summarising and   telling. They also identify particular features of effective practice in   mentoring and coaching which include; a learning conversation, reflection and   sharing, agreed outcomes, focus on learning and teaching, mutual benefit and   confidentiality.  
  <LI>Williams et al (1998) studied effective mentoring relationships in secondary   schools, highlighting the following: supporting, actively teaching, guiding,   providing information, offering practical strategies, feeding back on lessons,   providing clear assessments of practice.</LI>
</UL>
<strong>Stages of mentoring /   coaching</strong><BR>
The CUREE model does not indicate ways in which a mentoring /   coaching relationship might develop over time. For those who are involved in   PGCE programmes, where the mentoring relationship between a school-based mentor   and student-teacher lasts for several weeks, it is likely that the relationship   between mentor and mentee will evolve as they become more familiar with each   other, and as the student teacher becomes more at home in the environment and   more proficient in teaching. The following developmental models of mentoring   relationships shed some light on how such a relationship might develop:
<UL>
  <LI>Boydell (1994) proposes five stages through which a mentee may pass:   learning to implement; doing things well, learning to improve; doing things   better and learning to integrate; doing better things  
  <LI>Brookes &amp; Sikes (1997) put forward a stepped process which commences   initially with an apprenticeship approach with the mentor acting as the master   craftsman taking most of the initiative but steadily moving into that of   co-researchers.  
  <LI>Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus (1986) identify five states through which a mentee may   pass: novice, advanced beginning, competent, proficient, expert  
  <LI>Egan (2002) focuses on the interpersonal relationships and proposes a   three-stage &lsquo;helping&rsquo; model with various sub-steps. Stage 1 &ndash; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo;   which aims to help the &lsquo;client&rsquo; clarify the key issues and identify the need for   change; Stage 2 &ndash; &lsquo;What solutions make sense for me?&rsquo; which is designed to help   clients determine outcomes; Stage 3 &ndash; &lsquo;What do I have to do to get what I need   or want?&rsquo; which supports the client in developing strategies for achieving their   goals.  
  <LI>Fletcher (2004) draws upon Kolb&rsquo;s cycle of practice by proposing that   mentoring goes through a series of cycles of planning, experimentation and   review. With responsibility being shifted from mentor to mentee as the   relationship develops.  
  <LI>Furlong, Hirst, Pocklington &amp; Miles (1988) suggest four levels of   learning in student teachers: technical, practical, critical and emancipatory  
  <LI>Furlong &amp; Maynard (1995) propose five phases of development for   beginning teachers, though they are not necessarily sequential as the   student-teachers may move back and forth through them dependent on the   circumstances: Early Idealism, Personal Survival, Dealing With Difficulties,   Hitting A Plateau, Moving On (&ldquo;acting like a teacher&rdquo; and &ldquo;thinking like a   teacher)  
  <LI>Martin (1994) identifies three stages in the mentoring process: formal,   cordial, friendship  
  <LI>Maynard &amp; Furlong (1993) propose three models of mentoring: the   apprenticeship model, the competency model and the reflective practitioner   
  <LI>Pask &amp; Joy (2007) put forward six stages of what they deem to be   mentoring-coaching: Context, Issues, Responsibility, Future, Deciding, Action.   They suggest that mentoring-coaching is a unified process with mentor-coaches   shifting from one role to the other (and back again) as the relationship   develops.  
  <LI>Phillips-Jones (n.d.) suggests mentoring tends to follow the same pattern:   starting with &lsquo;mutual admiration&rsquo;, moving on to the &lsquo;development&rsquo; phase which   ultimately leads to &lsquo;disillusionment&rsquo;, and then &lsquo;parting&rsquo;. However despite this,   the outcome is considered to be &lsquo;transformation&rsquo;  
  <LI>Whitmore&rsquo;s (2002) GROW model of coaching outlines the four stages of a   coaching relationship as being the identification of the Goal (ie what does the   client want to achieve?), specifying the Reality of the current situation,   deciding what Options are available and finally choosing what Will be done to   achieve the desired outcome(s).</LI>
</UL>
<strong>The skills of mentoring and   coaching</strong><BR>
To augment or elaborate on your training and development   sessions for mentoring and coaching skills, you may want to refer to some of the   background literature and/or resources which relates to some of the theoretical   underpinning. <BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Developing relationships</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Bokeno (2009) suggests that as mentoring and coaching are a form of learning   relationship, it is important to match the relationship to the goals which   should determine the type of learning conversation  
  <LI>Egan (2001) emphasises humanistic approaches and sees relationships as a   &lsquo;working alliance&rsquo; - a collaborative, forum for relearning but needing to be   flexible. Values underpin the development of the relationship with a particular   emphasis on respect (do no harm, be competent and committed, show you are &lsquo;for   the client, assume the client&rsquo;s goodwill, don&rsquo;t rush to judgement, keep the   client&rsquo;s agenda as the focus) and be empathetic (but not sympathetic)  
  <LI>Whitmore (2002) suggests that building &lsquo;awareness&rsquo; and &lsquo;responsibility&rsquo; is   the essence of good coaching - "gathering a clear perception of the relevant   facts and information, and the ability to determine what is relevant", build   self-reliance, self belief, self confidence, self responsibility, "the   awareness-raising function of the expert coach is indispensable&rdquo;. A coach is not   a problem solver, teacher, instructor or expert - he is a sounding board,   facilitator, counsellor or awareness raiser.</LI>
</UL>
<strong><em>Modelling   practice</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Cruess, Cruess &amp; Steinert (2008) offer a view of &lsquo;role modelling&rsquo; from a   nursing perspective and identify key competences needed for a role model:   Clinical competence (ie knowledge and skills, communication with patients and   staff, and sound clinical reasoning and decision making.) , Teaching skills (ie   A student centred approach incorporating effective communication, feedback, and   opportunities for reflection) and Personal qualities (ie compassion, honesty,   and integrity, effective interpersonal relationships, enthusiasm for practice   and teaching, and an uncompromising quest for excellence)  
  <LI>Murray &amp; Main (2005) identify aspects of mentoring which include:   Befriending; Planning; Collaborating; Coaching; Reflecting. They put forward a   proposed framework for role modelling in action which includes communication and   assessment; planning, implementation and evaluation; and &lsquo;reflection on the   move&rsquo;</LI>
</UL>
<strong><em>Observation and Feedback</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Edge (1993) offers a highly personal view which stresses the importance of   listening, discussing alternatives, providing a feedback &lsquo;sandwich&rsquo; (ie   positive, identify issue, positive), and encouraging self-reflection.   
  <LI>Teachers TV (2008) <A href="external.html?link=http://www.teachers.tv/video/27078" target="blank">http://www.teachers.tv/video/27078</A> - A fifteen minute video   clip outlining key principles of giving feedback and setting targets with a   student-teacher

</UL>
<strong><em>Effective   Questioning</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Blair et al (2006) present the outcomes from an international project which   suggests effective questioning includes: Open questions, Closed questions,   Leading questions, Questions that follow the students&rsquo; interest, Clarifying   questions, Challenging questions, Incisive questions, and Questions that check   out commitment  
  <LI>Egan (2001) takes a counselling perspective and suggests; ask a limited   number of questions which are open ended. Use questions to explore possibilities   and which act as probes to clarify meaning and to uncover blind-spots.  
  <LI>Sinclair (n.d.) suggests questions which: support the coachee's learning   need to be open, encourage looking beyond the immediate, invite a personal   response, and promote commitment and action  
  <LI>Whitmore (2002) whose GROW model has become well established suggests   effective questions: compel thinking, demand high resolution focus, should seek   descriptive (v judgemental) answers, provide opportunities for feedback for   coach. He argues that questions need to evoke factual answers rather than   opinions, should be progressive focusing from broad to specific, and must follow   the coachee's lead rather than the coach&rsquo;s (hidden) agenda.  
  <LI>Zeus &amp; Skiffington (2002) argue that questioning is a core dialoguing   skill. How, What, When, Where, Why (with caution) questions help clarify the   situation and encourage descriptive responses. Clarifying, elaborating,   challenging and confronting questions help with active listening. There should   also be &lsquo;Appreciative Questioning&rsquo; (to focus on strengths) and &lsquo;Problem-Free   questioning&rsquo; (to focus on aspects of practice which are successful) . The   authors also place emphasis on the value of metaphors when   dialoguing.</LI>
</UL>
<strong><em>Target setting and action planning</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Mindtools.com (n.d.) outline the background to SMART goal setting and   stresses the need to take account of Clarity, Challenge, Commitment., Feedback   and Task complexity.   
  <LI>Whitmore (2002) suggests the most effective feedback is subjective and   descriptive &ndash; the worst is personal and judgemental. He argues that generating   high quality relevant feedback, from within rather than from an expert, is   essential for continuous improvement - Goals should be SMART (specific,   measurable, agreed, realistic, time phased), PURE (positively stated,   understood, Relevant, ethical) and CLEAR (challenging, legal, environmentally   sound, appropriate, recorded)</LI>
</UL>
<strong><em>Active listening </strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Robertson (2005) summarises &lsquo;Active Listening Skills&rsquo; as: attentive body   language: posture and gestures showing involvement and engagement, appropriate   body movement, appropriate facial expressions, appropriate eye contact,   conducted in a non-distracting environment. In addition, she lists: following   skills (ie giving the speaker space to tell their story in their own way),   asking interested &lsquo;door openers&rsquo;, using minimal verbal encouragers; and asking   infrequent, timely and considered questions. She stresses the importance of   attentive silences and reflecting skills (ie restating the feeling and/or   content with understanding and acceptance), paraphrasing (check periodically   that you&rsquo;ve understood), reflecting back feelings and content, and summarising   the major issues.  
  <LI>New Jersey Self-Help Group Clearinghouse (n.d.) <A href="external.html?link=http://www.medhelp.org/njgroups/WHAT%20IS%20ACTIVE%20LISTENING.pdf" target="blank">http://www.medhelp.org/njgroups/WHAT%20IS%20ACTIVE%20LISTENING.pdf</A> presents a useful summary sheet outlining the key principles of Active   Listening.</LI>
</UL>
<strong>Theoretical underpinning</strong><BR>
Because mentoring and   coaching touches upon a wide range of areas of learning, from interpersonal   communication, through emotional intelligence to learning theories such as   social constructivism, what follows is only a flavour of the background   literature. With teaching moving to become a Masters&rsquo; level profession, there is   likely to be an increasing need for mentors to refer and contribute to the   growing fields of literature on mentoring, coaching and hence draw upon key   sources.<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>General</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Burgess &amp; Shelton Mayes (2007) paper describes the value of mentoring   (for teaching assistants) in terms of their professional development through an   apprenticeship approach  
  <LI>Cain (2009) outlines the benefits for mentors in using research to inform   their work, identifying benefits of learning by reflecting and learning through   apprenticeship. It provides a useful overview of these two perspectives which   underpin mentoring and coaching</LI>
</UL>
<strong><em>Online Journals and resource   banks for mentoring and coaching</strong>
<UL>

</UL>
<strong><em>Emotional Intelligence (EI)</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Goleman (1998) provides what is probably the key text for defining EI. A   summary outlining the key issues can be downloaded from Business Summaries in a   Nutshell - <A href="external.html?link=http://www.irgworld.in/docs/Success/WorkingWithEmotionalIntelligence.pdf" target="blank">http://www.irgworld.in/docs/Success/WorkingWithEmotionalIntelligence.pdf</A>|  
  <LI>Locke (2005) suggests that EI is of limited value because 1. The definition   of the concept is constantly changing. 2. Most definitions are so all-inclusive   as to make the concept unintelligible. 3. One definition (e.g., reasoning with   emotion) involves a contradiction. 4. There is no such thing as actual emotional   intelligence, although intelligence can be applied to emotions as well as to   other life domains. He suggests a more productive approach is to explore   &lsquo;introspective skills&rsquo;.</LI>
</UL>
<strong><em>Informal Learning</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Colley, Hodkinson &amp; Malcolm (2003) provide a clear and detailed overview   of the background and applications of information and formal learning

  <LI>PracticebasedLearning.org (2008) provide information and resources related   to: Becoming a reflective practitioner, Assessment and reflection, Supervision   relationship and reflective practice, Learning from significant events, Tools   for reflection. Although aimed at health and social care practitioners, the   resources and ideas have relevance for ITT  
  <LI>Smith (2001) presents a useful overview of the underpinning for Argyris&rsquo;s   work, including theories in action and single and double loop learning  
  <LI>Tomlinson (1995) provides an overview of the teaching Cycle (Plan/Reflect &ndash;   Teach &ndash; Monitor outcome), developing professional knowledge, Reflective   Coaching, Mentoring Assistance, Progressively collaborative teaching (PCT),   effective facilitator</LI>

<UL>
  <LI>Cox (2003) argues for a constructivist approach which centres on the needs   of the mentee  
  <LI>Hoover (1996)presents a brief but well detailed overview on the implications   of constructivism on educational practice  
  <LI>Reusser (2001) proposes that dialogue through cognitive apprenticeship is   central to the development of teachers&rsquo; understanding of their practices based   on experience</LI>
</UL>
<strong><em>Situated Cognition</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Brill, Kim &amp; Galloway (2001) presents a clear overview of cognitive   apprenticeship and its relationship with situated cognition and communities of   practice &ndash; includes useful resources including video and flash animation  
  <LI>Edwards (1998) suggest that the context determines the style of learning. He   sees learning as knowledge to be acquired and then deployed v situated cognition  
  <LI>Lave &amp; Wenger (1991) suggest knowledge is conceived as socially situated   and constructed within communities of practice</LI>
</UL>
<strong><em>Action Learning /   Action Reflection Learning</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Marquardt (1999) identifies six components of action learning: 1. a problem   or challenge of importance to the group; 2. a group of four to eight members,   ideally from diverse backgrounds and/or parts of the organization; 3. a process   that emphasizes questions and reflection; 4. the power to take action on   strategies developed; 5. a commitment to learning at the individual, team and   organizational levels; and 6. an action learning coach who focuses on capturing   the learning and improving the skills of the group.  
  <LI>Revans (1982) was the originator of active learning &ndash; this seminal work   outlines the key principles  
  <LI>Rimanoczy (2007) describes the elements of Action Reflection Learning (ARL)   as - Ownership: taking ownership for one&rsquo;s learning, Sequenced learning,   Exchange of learnings, Just-in-time learning (just-in-time intervention),   Learning and personality styles, Appreciative approach, Linking: connecting the   concept with other contexts, Coaching one-on-one, Safe environments, Balance   task/learning, Learning coach, Holistic involvement of the individual,   Questioning, Feedback, Five-level system, Guided reflection, Unfamiliar   environments</LI>
