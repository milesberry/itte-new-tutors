<H2>Introduction to Delivering High Quality Training</H2>
<p><br>
  In making decisions about factors that might affect course outcomes for ICT and IT in ITT your professional judgement is essential. Although you work within frameworks determined by the Training and Development Agency for Schools and by the ICT and IT curriculum taught in your partnership schools, it is up to you to decide in detail what makes a good course.<br><br>No subject is, or should be, static. ICT is especially affected by change, both in the technologies we have to use and in the applications and affordances resulting from those new technologies. This presents a challenge to the ICT Subject Specialist. Your role is to be both <b>normative</B> (that is, you should enable trainees to teach effectively in schools as they are presently structured) and <b>innovative.</B> That is, you should constantly develop the subject content that trainees acquire and the way in which that knowledge is taught or applied in learning and teaching. The Professional Standard Q8 requires that trainees have a creative and constructively critical approach to innovation.<br><br>Your mission as an ICT subject specialist teacher educator is to fulfil both roles.<br><br>In the following pages we set out some of the factors that can affect the quality of course outcomes.<br><br>There are no simple answers. It is not possible to point you in the direction of a single set of resources, materials or documents that will provide complete solutions. There are only frameworks, constraints, and choices. There are not even any syllabuses or appropriate schemes of work to draw from.<br><br>In this respect the tutor's role in ITT is perhaps more challenging than teaching in a secondary school. At the same time it is more rewarding because individual tutors and teams of tutors are the architects of good quality provision.<br><br>Good quality ICT teachers are more than just practitioners who can produce good results from GCSE and A level students.  Not only will they have to develop a subject expertise, but must ensure that even non-specialist students have skills, knowledge and understanding to function in a society where many of the current driving influences are ICT related.  ICT is a key skill.<br><br>Further to this, ICT is unique in its ability to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in other subjects.  In good practice this should be a natural and unremarkable occurrence but is probably most evident in the primary phase where the same teacher delivers across the range of subjects.  It may be less intrinsic in the secondary phase where subjects are taught more discretely and by different individuals.  There may even be an ethos of protection which discourages overlap into other subject areas.<br><br>A good ICT teacher in a secondary school, therefore, can make a significant difference to standards generally that would not be the case, for example, with a good history teacher.  However, trainee teachers need to be informed to be aware of the ‘value added’ nature of the role and the significance of the cross curricular implications of ICT.<br><br>Firstly, these individuals would need to be "public relations" sensitive – not everyone will welcome what may be seen as an intrusion into their subject teaching, however effective the ideas or well meaning the intentions.  Secondly, the trainees would have to be prepared to learn beyond their own subject and to have more than a passing familiarity with the requirements of the curriculum as a whole.  Thirdly, a very solid grounding in pedagogy is necessary to ensure that the enhancement potential of ICT is fully understood and used appropriately.<br><br>Good ICT teachers have the potential to be very special.  If this is recognised and exploited at the training stage, everybody will ultimately benefit.<br>author: David Longman, Lynne Jones, Richard Clarke and&nbsp;John&nbsp;Woollard<br>

<H1>The Professional Standards Q1 to Q33</H1>
<BR>
All ITT courses in England are   required to work within the framework published by the Training and Development   Agency for Schools - Professional Standards for Teachers Qualified Teacher   Status. These are set out in the document which can be obtained from the TDA   website: <A href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/teachers/professionalstandards/downloads.aspx" target="blank">Professional Standards for Teachers Why sit still in your   career?</A><BR>
<BR>
The Professional Standards Q1 to Q33<BR>
<BR>
Q1 to Q9   Professional attributes - how trainees should behave<BR>
Q10 to Q21 Professional   knowledge and understanding - what trainees should know<BR>
Q22 to Q33   Professional skills - what trainees should be able to do<BR>
<BR>
An alternative   approach is to consider the Professional Standards as a set of themes.<BR>
<BR>
A   most important document is TDA0396 - Professional Standards for Qualified   Teacher Status and Requirements for Initial Teacher Training. This too contains   the Professional Standards but also contains the requirements placed upon ITT   Institutions <BR>
<BR>
R1.1 GCSE requirement<BR>
R1.2 Degree requirement<BR>
R1.3 to   R1.5 the suitability of applicants<BR>
<BR>
R2.1 to R2.7 refer to the training   requirements.<BR>

<H1>Getting the Right Students</H1>
<BR>
Selecting and recruiting the right   students for a course is a critical factor in delivering high quality   outcomes. All ITT providers must ensure all of the following:<BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GCSE of grade C or equivalent in English and mathematics - a level 2   certificate is insufficient; it needs to be accompanied by evidence of a breadth   of understanding and experience in the subject area.<BR>
  <BR>
  Recruits to   programmes to teach pupils aged 3 to 11 years must also have a GCSE of grade C   or equivalent in a science subject.<BR>
  <BR>
  A first degree or the equivalent -   the TDA places the responsibility for deciding the degree equivalence upon the   ITT provider.<BR>
  <BR>
  All entrants must be subjected to a CRB enhanced   disclosure.<BR>
  <BR>
  All entrants must be interviewed and it must be established   that they have the academic capability and the qualities, attitudes and values   to be a teacher. They must be able to read effectively and be able to   communicate in standard English.<BR>
  <BR>
  The training must be resourced and   structured to enable the trainees to demonstrate all of the Professional   Standards. There must be equality of access to resources and training. The   training must take account of the individual needs.<BR>
  <BR>
  The training must   cover at least two stages of education and trainees must have experience of the   stages before and after the ones they are trained to   teach.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Recruitment into teacher training for IT and ICT is difficult   in many areas of the UK. Consequently, there is a tension between the need to   meet quotas and fill the course and ensure high standards of   recruitment.<BR>
<BR>
One tension is the desire to have trainees with degrees in   computing. A strategy may be required to accommodate applicants whose first   degree is not computing. For example...<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Entry without a degree in   computing</strong><BR>
Those applicants with degrees in business studies, information   systems, joint honours may be accepted unconditionally because of the level of   IT/ICT/computing in their studies. Those with degrees with no computing element   would have requirements to evidence their capability to work at graduate level   in an aspect of computing and have sufficient skills, knowledge and   understanding to be able to support pupils at all levels (attainment targets) in   the Key Stage 3 and 4 National Curriculum. Applicants may have requirements   placed upon them to complete before the start of the programme including some or   all of these: provide copies of prior assignments in the IT field that are at   level 4; write a 3000 word assignment about an aspect of applied computer   technologies considered to be at level 4 (undergraduate); provide a report of   their commercial experience of using IT and/or training in the IT field and/or   voluntary work in IT related field. This requirement varies between   providers.<BR>
<BR>
Other activities can be introduced in an attempt to ensure   that entrants have the required qualities and capabilities.<BR>
<BR>
For example,   "Applicants do not necessarily have to have a computing degree but must have   significant computing skills, training and experience. Trainees without a   traditional computing degree are accepted on the programme providing that they   have the appropriate experience, expertise and motivation. You must have skills   in all 'office' software (in particular database management and spreadsheets),   ability to create and publish web pages and some programming/scripting   experience at some level between writing macros/VBA and PASCAL/C++ inclusive. As   a Information Technology trainee teacher you should consider that you are   undertaking to work at GCE Computing standard (see syllabus, for example, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce.php" target="blank">http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce.php</A>)." <BR>
<BR>
"Applicants need   to show those qualities of personality, presentation, confidence and sensitivity   required to be a teacher. Also, they need to show an awareness of the current   educational process and a knowledge of the work of schools. We strongly   recommend obtaining classroom experience before the interview. Candidates will   normally have had recent experience of a secondary school ICT classroom.   Teaching is a challenging and rewarding profession; teaching ICT is a very good   way in which we can enhance the lives of young people."<BR>
<BR>
"In preparation   for the interview we advise you to spend time in a secondary school observing   ICT classes, reading National Curriculum documents/textbooks and talking to   IT/ICT teachers so that you can, with confidence, talk about what teaching ICT   is like. You must be convincing of your informed desire to become an ICT   teacher. We regard this as especially important when someone is leaving another   field of employment to train as a teacher."<BR>
<BR>
"If you are offered and   accept a place, then a number of additional &lsquo;Requirements of Entry&rsquo; (in the form   of pre-entry experiences) will be specified. You will set yourself targets to   achieve, that will strengthen your teaching potential, before starting the   course. For example: visit the local library and browse the children&rsquo;s computer   books; create a number of web pages and post them to a server; obtain a GCE   level computing text book and become familiar with its organisation; review all   the generic functions of a word processor, spreadsheet, database management   program, web page editor and a graphics program (including drawing, painting and   charting); use LOGO. By accepting a place on the course, you are acknowledging   that you have good skills in all forms of office-type software (see above). You   are also stating you have good capability in handling new software, being able   to explore functions in a systematic as well as an imaginative way."<BR>
<BR>
As   part of the qualifying process, trainee teachers must complete the QTS Skills   Tests after the programme starts. Details can be found at <A href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/skillstests.aspx" target="blank">http://www.tda.gov.uk/skillstests.aspx</A><BR>

<H1>How to Gauge the Appropriate Level of Study</H1>
<BR>
There are two broad ways   to look at the depth of study required for ITT courses:<BR>
<strong><BR>
Students are   taught sufficient ICT to enable them to the teach the target Key Stage of the   course they are following.<BR>
</strong><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em>This is the 'just enough' approach. Most useful in cases where ICT   courses are part of a wider curriculum of subjects, and/or where ICT is taught   in a cross-curricular context.<BR>
  In relation to meeting the standards, we would   assume that there is a minimum threshold of knowledge and expertise that enables   a trainee to "meet the standards". This approach allows us to define and apply   this minimum threshold.</em></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Students are taught to the   highest level attainable in relation to the standards and criteria of the   courses they are following, regardless of target Key Stage.<BR>
</strong><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em>Here, specialist subject study courses or modules would be more   likely to teach content to this level.<BR>
  The definition of "highest level   obtainable" is open. For degree level courses we would assume that the student   will work to a level beyond that of the Key Stage they are likely to teach (by   implication this means beyond 'A' level). For postgraduate courses we would   assume that this level of knowledge and expertise is in   place.</em></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><BR>
  <BR>
  Of course, mere "quantity" of knowledge is not   enough. We also have to think about the level at which knowledge is understood   and the level to which trainee teachers can communicate that knowledge and   understanding - that is the pedagogic content knowledge.<BR>
  <BR>
  A PGCE is   sometimes described as post-graduate in name but not in nature, and indeed to be   genuinely post-graduate all or most of the content of the program would have to   be pitched at Masters&rsquo; level. The structure of PGCE courses will vary from one   provider to the next but generally they tend to be pitched at level 5/6 with the   understanding of teaching practice occasionally assessed at level M. <BR>
  <BR>
  Some institutions differentiate between students by offering the PGCE in   two ways:<BR>
  <strong>Professional Graduate Certificate of Education</strong> - studied   post-graduate but not achieving Masters level;<BR>
  <strong>Postgraduate Certificate in   Education</strong> - studied and achieving standards equivalent to Masters   level.<BR>
  This differentiation can be achieved by students electing to study at   Masters level or their work is submitted and is summatively assessed to be at   professional or postgraduate level.<BR>
  <BR>
  Guidance and further explanation of   the structures and levels found in Higher Education courses can be found on the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/" target="blank">QAA</A> website,   following the links Academic Infrastructure &gt; Subject benchmark statements   &gt; Master's level benchmark statements. The statements pertinent to computing   and education have not yet been developed but there is a summary of discussions   from the event held in February 2006, providing an overview of opinions   surrounding the possibility of developing benchmarks for academic programmes at   M level.<BR>
  <BR>
  The second issue is the depth to which trainees are required to   engage with the subject pedagogy and the subject itself. Subject pedagogy   usually presents less of a problem as candidates are often required to reflect   upon and critically evaluate their own and others' practice, thus fulfilling the   appropriate criteria for the level. The delivery of subject knowledge can   present more of a problem as the academic level of the course requires an   engagement at a level far above that required in terms of operational delivery   of the subject.<BR>
  <BR>
  For PGCE students with an appropriate degree this is not   usually a problem. For some QTS courses, and in particular two year top up from   HND models, additional support may be necessary. The TDA provide <A href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/Recruit/thetrainingprocess/pretrainingcourses/subjectenhancementextensioncourses.aspx" target="blank">subject enhancement programmes</A> which may be as short as 10 days   and as long as 12 months. A further consideration here is the phases that   trainees are expected to teach on as the level of subject knowledge required at   KS5/AS/A2/AVCE/Diploma level will inevitably be far more detailed than that   required for key stages 2, 3 and 4. There is also the tension between the   computing body of knowledge and the ICT body of knowledge. The two are blurred   and elements of traditional programming are becoming more relevant in ICT   including:<BR>
  <BR>
  <A href="external.html?link=http://www.softronix.com/logo.html" target="blank">LOGO</A> to give spacial and algorithm awareness;<BR>
  <A href="external.html?link=http://scratch.mit.edu/" target="blank">Scratch</A>, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.greenfoot.org/" target="blank">Greenfoot</A>,   etc. to give awareness of sequencing and algorithm;<BR>
  Game authoring tools like <A href="external.html?link=http://www.yoyogames.com/" target="blank">Game   Maker</A>, to develop narrative and scripting skills;<BR>
  Control technology   programming languages and graphical interfaces such as <A href="external.html?link=http://www.crocodile-clips.com/" target="blank">Crocodile   Clips</A> and <A href="external.html?link=http://www.flowol.com/" target="blank">Flowol</A> that develop logic and programming.<BR>
  Macro writing in   office-type software, such as <A href="external.html?link=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/FAQ/Macros" target="blank">OpenOffice</A>, to show automation of processes.<BR>
  HTML and   associated web page construction to show the values of scripting and   organisation of data (folder structure).<BR>
  <BR>
  Some 11-16 QTS courses meet   their obligation to "engage with the expectations, curricula, strategies and   teaching arrangements in the age phases immediately before and after the ones   they are trained to teach" by requiring trainees to spend time in those   classrooms and make presentations to their peers at a level above that they are   trained to teach. For example, a directed activity might be to: <em>teach to the   rest of the group an assigned computing topic through a short lesson of no more   than 15 minutes and create a web page and three A4 sheets including: an activity   sheet, a worksheet and an information sheet then locate the topic in the GNVQ   GCE AVCE GCSE curriculum [2.1d]</em> Topics are assigned from: CPU; Prolog;   Keywords; Logic; Normalisation; Sorting; Queues; Stacks; Encryption; Binary;   GIF/JPEG; JavaScript; VisualBasic; Encryption; Compression; Recursion; VBA; SQL;   Linux; Interrupts; PSS etc.<BR>
  <BR>

</p>
<H1>Equipping students with sufficient pedagogical knowledge </H1>
<BR>
How can   tutors ensure that they equip students with sufficient pedagogical knowledge and   understanding to become effective and reflective teachers?<BR>
<BR>
All PGCE and   QTS courses should have modules on teaching studies or similarly titled elements   that address this aspect of professional practice. Typical areas that are   covered include:
<UL>
  <LI>Strategies for differentiation  
  <LI>Inclusive education  
  <LI>Classroom management  
  <LI>Pupil motivation  
  <LI>Effective planning, delivery and evaluation</LI>
</UL>
Resources to assist in   the delivery of these topics can be found at:<BR>

<A href="external.html?link=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/" target="blank">TeacherNet</A><BR>
<BR>
Opportunities for trainees to develop   teaching skills should also be included as an early part of the course with   teaching studies used as an opportunity for trainees to try out short teaching   events (microteaching) to peers, sample marking and moderation sessions and   having a go at exam papers likely to be sat by pupils.<BR>

<H1>The Features of Quality Provision</H1>
<BR>
Quality and Standards in Secondary   Initial Teacher Training (2003) is the Ofsted report on three years&rsquo; inspection   of Secondary ITT courses, 1999-2002. Although the report does not cover ICT   specialist courses some useful indications of the features of good quality   provision in this area are indicated. There is some lack of clarity in the   report about the quality of ICT specialist subject courses. On the whole the   report treats ICT as a cross curricular issue and treats it in terms of the use   of ICT in the teaching of other subjects.<BR>
<BR>
In general terms, trainees&rsquo;   fitness to teach was found to be good and their use of ICT greatly improved. The   introduction of 4/98 in 1999 was found to be useful in this regard and had   helped to raise the standards in terms of what trainees were taught about the   use of ICT in subject teaching. Annex B contained a comprehensive list of skills   and concepts associated with the educational use of ICT including the terms   provenance and provisionality when associated with the worldwide web. However,   poor resources in some partnership schools continued to hamper development. In   addition, too few trainees had knowledge of or strategies for dealing with   transition from KS2 to KS3 and trainees&rsquo; use of assessment to inform planning   continued to be weak.<BR>
<BR>
Generally providers made <strong>ineffective</strong> use of   subject knowledge audits. Self-audits were felt to be almost useless whereas in   the best practice audits were systematically collected and analysed by staff and   strategies were in place to help trainees develop their areas of weakness in the   subject.<BR>
<BR>
The role of the school mentor in ensuring that subject knowledge   is adapted for teaching purposes is crucial but at times was found to be poor.   In the case of the embedded use of ICT in subject teaching, mentors&rsquo; own lack of   knowledge resulted in poor trainee development. This was found to be   particularly the case in training that was entirely   school-based.<BR>
<BR>
Training was often found to be effective and of good   quality where
<UL>
  <LI>recent developments in the subject are covered to ensure trainees are   up-to-date when they start work;  
  <LI>assignments are linked to school experience;  
  <LI>a systematic programme of skills development is provided;  
  <LI>there is good integration between subject study, school experience and   professional studies;  
  <LI>trainees' subject knowledge is systematically audited, and   monitored.</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
The following year, the Annual Report from Ofsted made   this limited reference to ICT in ITT "Secondary teacher training has improved in   a number of areas. Trainees are now better prepared to use ICT in their   teaching. The Key Stage 3 Strategy receives appropriate attention and has helped   to improve aspects of trainees&rsquo; teaching, for example, planning in subjects such   as ICT". <A href="external.html?link=http://live.ofsted.gov.uk/publications/annualreport0304" target="blank">http://live.ofsted.gov.uk/publications/annualreport0304</A><BR>
<BR>
In   subsequent years, Ofsted has not commented upon the use of ICT in ITT nor the   teaching of the subject of ICT.<BR>
