  <b>Models of Teaching - Introduction</b><br><br>Learning takes place in many different ways and in many different settings.  Sometimes the learning is intentional; sometimes not.  Some of the situations involve teaching, i.e.  when someone designs activities with the intention that someone else learns from participating in them.  All of these activities require a range of strategies to make the learning accessible for the students and in order to discuss and analyse teaching situations effectively, it is sensible to group them into different underlying models.<br><br>
  <b>What this resource <i>is</i></b><br><br>-	a collection of ideas, resources, activities, video clips for new tutors to use with their students to make them think, reflect critique, the concept of what learning is, and how learning and teaching  can be made more effective.<br><br>
  <b>What this resource <i>isn't</i></b><br><br>-	a solution to the question <i>“What is the best model of teaching?”</i><br><br><br>author: Helen Smith/Debbie Simpson<br>
</p>
<H1><strong>The challenge of teacher education &ndash; student trainees&rsquo;   perceptions</strong></H1>
<BR>
<BR>
Educating student teacher trainees in the art of   teaching is a difficult task. This resource aims to assist the new tutor in   guiding students through the numerous theories, pedagogies, models, strategies,   paradigms &ndash; and the (often) synonymous use of these terms. There is no shortage   of information on learning theories, but often the difficulty is drilling down   to what is meaningful and presenting it in a format that is accessible for   students. Replicating information in the form of handouts is straightforward,   but reviewing the information critically, making comparisons and identifying the   underlying concepts of theory and its importance are more difficult to   develop.<BR>
<BR>
Students as teacher trainees, too often focus on <A href="external.html?link=http://www.infed.org/biblio/b-learn.htm" target="blank">content</A> and not enough on <A href="external.html?link=http://www.infed.org/biblio/b-learn.htm" target="blank">process.</A> Hopefully through deeper understanding of the process   (teaching methodology, strategy, progression, differentiation) sound models will   be developed that suit the students&rsquo; own teaching style. Students need to be   challenged about teaching techniques through their own experiences as learners   (e.g. of being taught by teachers using a variety of models or approaches) and   also through developing and mastering their own techniques and strategies. <BR>
<BR>
The challenge exists therefore, to change students&rsquo; mindsets that   teaching ICT is all about product; creating yet another leaflet or   mechanistically producing spreadsheet models without a deeper understanding of   the purpose and process. The QCA&rsquo;s <A href="external.html?link=http://www.qca.org.uk/qca_5856.aspx/" target="blank">big   picture of the curriculum</A> reinforces the concept of the curriculum as &ldquo;the   entire planned learning experience of a young person&rdquo; and should provide the   framework around which strategies or models can be developed. There may be   further opportunities to make links to the current agendas of <A href="external.html?link=http://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/" target="blank">ECM,</A> <A href="external.html?link=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/newrelationship/personalisedlearning/" target="blank">Personalised Learning,</A> <A href="external.html?link=http://www.qca.org.uk/qca_6444.aspx/" target="blank">Key   Skills,</A> assessment and testing issues (for example, broadening the scope of   ICT content to teach meaningful lessons, but focusing on arrangement documents   and syllabi dictated by examination frameworks) but this is not the main focus   of this resource.<BR>

<strong>Suggested   Preliminary Activities - Perceptions of Teaching</strong><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Activity 1 &ndash; </strong><BR>
All students have experienced learning through a variety of models   (different types of lesson, school, teacher, resources) and all will have   existing views on what constituted &lsquo;good&rsquo; teaching/teachers and &lsquo;not so good&rsquo;   teaching/teachers.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Individually:</strong><BR>
Think of your best teacher, or   one who influenced you the most. What personal qualities made them unique in   this respect? (Write down a few points to share with the rest of the   group)<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Groups:</strong><BR>
In groups, consider the following and discuss   the main points with a view to feeding back to the rest of the class at the end   of the session.<BR>
<BR>
- What is &lsquo;effective teaching&rsquo;? (as opposed to the   effective teacher considered above)<BR>
- What do you think are the elements of   &lsquo;effective teaching&rsquo; that support and promote effective learning?<BR>
- What   makes an effective lesson?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Activity 2 - Reading </strong><BR>
The   Scenario from <A href="external.html?link=http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/0335198317/ref=sib_dp_ptu/" target="blank">Prosser and Trigwell (2001) p1-5</A> is recommended as initial   reading for discussion to provide a focus for subsequent sessions. (One student,   at the end of the year, failed his examination. The other student passed with   distinction. Both were taught by the same tutor, covered the same syllabus,   attended the same lectures and tutorials and completed the same   assignments.)<BR>

<H1><strong>Defining the term Models of Teaching</strong></H1>
<BR>
&ldquo;At first, when people   create or find a new model of teaching that works for some purpose, they&rsquo;re so   thrilled they try to use it for everything. Our job is to find some order &ndash;   finding out what each model can do and building categories to help folks find   the tools they need.&rdquo; <BR>
<BR>
(Joyce, B 2002; p 27)<BR>
<BR>
The term &ldquo;Models of   Teaching&rdquo; has many interpretations and new tutors should discuss with their   students what the term means to them. On asking a few experienced tutors in   Higher Education what they understood by the term &ldquo;Models of Teaching&rdquo; it was   interesting to note the variation in their responses. Some of these are listed   here and may provide a starting point for discussion with your   students:<BR>
<BR>
- various strategies that facilitate learning through different   models or approaches<BR>
- techniques for teaching such as mastery learning,   drill and skill, direct teaching, blended approaches, elearning<BR>
- Is there   such a thing as Models of Teaching? Should this read Models of Learning?<BR>
-   Developing independent learners through whatever means available<BR>
- Pedagogies   and philosophies for teaching and learning<BR>
- Delivering the product in a   meaningful, interesting way<BR>
<BR>
The list above is only a small sample of the   many responses from one Higher Education Institution.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout this   resource the term &lsquo;model&rsquo; will be used to define a variety of ways of teaching,   but the following definitions may help the new tutor set this resource in   context:<BR>
<BR>
A <strong>model of teaching</strong> is a set of related practices which   teachers can adopt in order to help achieve particular learning objectives   (similar terms &ndash; approach, strategy, method, learning design)<BR>
<BR>
A <strong>pedagogy</strong> is a coherent set of beliefs and practices, often associated   with a particular teacher, subject or professional development initiative   (similar term &ndash; style, methodology, paradigm, theory)<BR>
<BR>
A <strong>technique</strong> is a well-defined procedure which may be combined with others within an overall   model of teaching, e.g. demonstrate and ask student to repeat; whole class   brainstorm; discuss with partner; hotseat. <BR>
<H1><strong>The Video Resource </strong></H1>
<p><BR>
  <BR>
  The video resource is an open-ended,   extensible collection of video clips which new tutors may find useful in   prompting discussion about approaches to teaching. <BR>
  <BR>
  Currently, many of   the video clips are sourced from <A href="external.html?link=http://www.teachers.tv/video" target="blank">Teachers   TV.</A> The clips can be used in an open-ended way initially, encouraging   student analysis and reflection, with the aim of linking theory and practice at   a later stage. <BR>
  New tutors could consider filming their own students teaching   and those clips could be used in a similar way to encourage self and peer   analysis and feedback. <BR>

  <BR>
  <strong>Activities</strong><em> (text in italics does not   appear on the Student Prompt Sheet)</em>:<BR>
  <BR>
  From your observations <BR>
  <BR>
  -   What, in your opinion, were the observable variables that influenced the   teaching/learning process?<BR>
  <BR>
  - Suggest other variables which weren&rsquo;t   observed in the video, but may have also influenced the teaching/learning   process. <BR>
  <em>(possible suggestions may include: home, peer influence,   community, religion, health, society, culture, international conditions, social   conditions; also variables that may occur in the classroom; such as Teacher   behaviour; Pupil behaviour; plus &lsquo;other&rsquo; factors. ). </em><BR>

  <BR>
  - With reference to the qualities identified in the   preliminary task &ldquo;What makes a good teacher?&rdquo; - which of those qualities did you   observe in the video clip? <em>For example: verbal ( humour, providing examples,   questioning techniques, learning and using students&rsquo; names, inviting feedback,   using praise) and non-verbal ( body language, smiling, maintaining eye contact,   facial expressions, demeanour)</em><BR>
  <BR>
  - From your observations, could you   determine what the student/teacher was hoping to achieve? What were the pupils   actually learning? Could you separate and identify the content from the process   of what was being taught?<BR>
  <BR>
  - How many different approaches can you think   of to teach (for example) the COUNTIF function in a spreadsheet? <em>(any ICT   concept can be inserted here). Strategies could include text books,   demonstration, lecture, video clip, podcast, activity   sheet.</em><BR>

<H1><strong>Models of Teaching &ndash; models and theories</strong></H1>
<BR>
<BR>
&ldquo;If you learn   only methods, you'll be tied to your methods, but if you learn principles you   can devise your own methods.&rdquo; <BR>
Ralph Waldo Emerson (1837)<BR>
<BR>
The key   questions for new tutors may be:<BR>
Why teach learning theory? (and our students   often ask this question!)<BR>
How can we make this knowledge meaningful and   accessible for our students?<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Learning paradigms</strong> (the framework of   theories).<BR>
<BR>
It may be useful to consider <strong>paradigms</strong> under the   following headings:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://www.learning-theories.com/behaviorism.html" target="blank">Behaviourism (Pavlov, Skinner, Bandura)</A>
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://www.learning-theories.com/cognitivism.html" target="blank">Cognitivism (Bruner, Gagne)</A>
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://www.learning-theories.com/category/constructivist-theories" target="blank">Constructivism (Social and Situational) (Piaget, Vygotsky,)</A>
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://www.emtech.net/learning_theories.htm" target="blank">Miscellaneous others</A> (mainly derivatives of the above)  
  <LI>An excellent resource is available at <A href="external.html?link=http://www.schome.ac.uk/wiki/Educational_thinkers" target="blank">Schome</A>
  <LI>An introduction to Theories and Learning and further links on learning   theory is available <A href="external.html?link=http://otec.uoregon.edu/learning_theory.htm" target="blank">here</A></LI>
</UL>
<BR>
<strong>Why learn about theory?</strong><BR>
<BR>
An   in-depth study of learning theory is perhaps beyond the scope of this resource,   but the rationale for including some study of learning theory for teacher   trainees is:<BR>
<BR>
&bull; Theories influence what we believe about learning (and how   we believe people learn)<BR>
&bull; Theories should also influence how we teach so   that people learn; and how we evaluate our teaching.<BR>
&bull; A study of theory,   differentiates between the instructional design process (sequential steps   required in guiding the student learning) and the critical understanding of the   most appropriate approaches based on research.<BR>
&bull; Addressing QTS standards   Q10. Q12 and in particular Q14 &ndash; &ldquo;Have a secure knowledge and understanding of   their subjects/curriculum areas and related pedagogy to enable them to teach   effectively across the age and ability range for which they are   trained.&rdquo;<BR>

<BR>
<strong>From   Theories to Models</strong><BR>
<BR>
Joyce, Weil and Calhoun (2004) have grouped models   of teaching into four "families", each built around the thinking of key   theorists accompanied by a rationale based on research that tests those theories   for achieving the learning goals for which they were designed. <BR>
<UL>
  <LI><strong>Behavioural System Family of Models</strong>
  <LI><strong>Information Processing Family of Models</strong>
  <LI><strong>Personal Family of Models</strong>
  <LI><strong>Social Family of Models</strong></LI>
