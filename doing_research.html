<H2>Doing Research - Overview</H2>
<br>There is a open agenda for researching ICT as a subject and opportunities to make a difference at a pivotal stage in the development of our subject. In order to carry out research you need a research interest, <a href="text_onlybde1.html?url=/index.php&amp;layout=1&amp;sec=6&amp;tp=2&amp;ts=2">a research strategy</a> and <a href="text_only5272.html?url=/index.php&amp;layout=1&amp;sec=6&amp;tp=2&amp;ts=3">to write for an audience</a>. Each is considered in turn. A further section deals with <a href="text_only4239.html?url=/index.php&amp;layout=1&amp;sec=6&amp;tp=2&amp;ts=4">supervising research students</a> and encouraging others to write.<br><br><B>Research interests</B><br>You may well have a personal research agenda growing out of your work with trainee teachers, your observation of schools or your own recent practice as an ICT teacher. This may well lead you into action research inquiry based on problems you face in your practice. If you want to go further and ask what are the general issues faced in research of teaching of ICT the list is endless and several lines of inquiry have been suggested in these pages. A focus group of ICT researchers identified these questions as priorities, do you agree? <br><blockquote>•	key stage 3: issues in implementing the strategy<br>•	assessment and ICT: why is practice so poor and what can be done <br>•	the missing link: what is the connection between key stage 3 and qualification courses?<br>•	the three part lesson: opportunity or straightjacket? <br>•	the place of metaphor in teaching ICT concepts<br>•	what is subject knowledge in relation to ICT?<br>•	is ICT an academic subject?<br>•	why do pupils like ICT?<br></blockquote>

<H1>Research strategies</H1>
<BR>
Research guides frequently distinguish between   &lsquo;positivist&rsquo; approaches and more naturalist or interpretivist approaches (Cohen   and Mannion 1994). The former is rooted in an experimental approach which, put   briefly, starts with a hypothesis, involves setting up experimental and control   groups, designing pre and post testing and accumulating evidence to check   whether a hypothesis is valid. The latter is more interested in interpretations   which teachers and pupils put on teaching and learning and is more likely to   explore the use of ICT in natural settings. For example, a positivist might ask   does ICT have an impact on learning and design settings in which experiments in   learning could take place. An interpretivist might be inclined to go into   classrooms as they are and ask who thinks ICT has an impact on learning and why   do they think that. <BR>
<BR>
Once you have decided in which tradition you feel   more comfortable you might then think about theoretical perspectives such as   grounded theory (eg one view is offered by Strauss and Corbin 1998); activity   theory (Center for Activity Theory and Developmental Work Research, 2004) and   action research (Carr and Kemmis 1986) or more quantitative / statistical   approaches (eg Muijs 2004). There is though no need to see quantitative methods   as the preserve of positivist / experimental approaches. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>A research   approach fit for purpose</strong><BR>
If you are in the position of being relatively   new to educational research, but with a wealth of practitioner experience on   which to draw, you may be well placed to carry out action research of your own.   There is no single definition of action research but common to most commentators   is an interest in reflecting on your practice and implementing and evaluating an   innovation to address a problem or difficulty within your work. Some action   research projects are strongly focused on you and your innovation (for example,   does online conferencing effectively support student teachers on placement?).   Some are much more focused on the constraints on practice and collective action   in order to overcome these constraints. <BR>
<BR>
There is a huge literature on   action research and very many web sites &ndash;for example, infed.org offers a guide   created by a small group of educators at <A href="external.html?link=http://www.infed.org/research/b-actres.htm" target="blank">www.infed.org/research/b-actres.htm</A>. You might find   practitioner guides to carrying out research useful in carrying out your   research, for example, the Scottish Centre Research in Education <A href="external.html?link=http://www.scre.ac.uk/" target="blank">http://www.scre.ac.uk/</A> produces a set of classroom guides and   there are a great many books including Barton and Bartlett (2005); Hopkins   (2002); and Sagor (2005). Carrying out your own action research project will, of   course, help you lead student teachers in carrying out their projects. However,   it is one approach amongst many. You may prefer to work within a different   tradition - a more observational standing back ethnographic approach or perhaps   a more interventionist approach on a grander scale. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>Projects and   bids</strong><BR>
Educational research is time consuming and you may want to   investigate collaborative approaches to research &ndash; many first time researchers   are happy to attach themselves to larger projects being undertaken in their   institution that are led by more established researchers. You might want to   search for funding of your own, or more likely in a collaborative project of   some kind. Funding will allow you to pay for research assistance and meet   expenses such as transcribing tapes, travel, purchase of special equipment,   attending conferences and so on. Your application may be proactive - the result   of a great deal of reflection over time - or reactive there is a deadline for a   new round of projects to which your institution wants you to respond. Some   important sources of funding are:<BR>
<BR>
&bull; Economic and Social Research Council   (ESRC) (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/" target="blank">http://www.esrc.ac.uk/</A>)<BR>
&bull; Foundations such as Leverhulme   Trust (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.leverhulme.org.uk/" target="blank">http://www.leverhulme.org.uk</A>), Esm&eacute;e Fairbairn Foundation (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk/" target="blank">http://www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk/</A>), The Nuffield Foundation (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/" target="blank">http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org</A>), Gatsby Foundation (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.gatsby.org.uk/" target="blank">http://www.gatsby.org.uk</A>)<BR>
&bull; Government or Government   supported bodies such as DCSF, TDA, GTC, Becta. Note Becta has run a small   grants scheme in the past which has supported scholarly practitioner   research<BR>
&bull; Other educational bodies such as Specialist Schools Trust<BR>
&bull; EU   funding <BR>
<BR>
Nearly all sources of funding imply stiff competition &ndash; you can   improve your chances of getting funding by:
<BLOCKQUOTE>&bull; paying close attention to what the funder will and will not cover <BR>
  &bull; where possible getting formative feedback from the funder on how well your   proposal fits with their brief<BR>
  &bull; getting peer feedback on your bid<BR>
  &bull;   making your bid a collaborative one - here you are ideally placed to involve   partner schools in your bid and produce an effective dissemination   strategy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Don&rsquo;t underestimate the time involved in writing a bid and   the time needed to carry out a successful project - you cannot leave it in the   hands of research assistants. Remember that although you may have a well   presented project proposal most bids are rejected by most organisations because   of pressure on funds. Be persistent and learn from the   feedback.<BR>

<H1>Research writing</H1>
<BR>
This section looks at communicating your work to   public audiences. It discusses reasons for writing; opportunities for writing;   challenges in writing and the process of writing. It suggests entry points into   writing for academic audiences.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Why write?</strong><BR>
The best and most   obvious reason is that there is something you want to communicate to your   colleagues about teaching and learning with ICT. You went into teaching to make   a difference and you can make a difference through your writing even if your   audience is removed from you in place and time. However, you may have   additional, more extrinsic, reasons for writing, for example, publication of   work may help you get a permanent contract, a promotion, or help you get   recognition from your colleagues. In many departments there is an expectation on   you to publish as part of a contribution to the highly competitive Research   Assessment Exercise. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>Opportunity</strong><BR>
As discussed elsewhere in   this research section, ICT is a new subject and possibilities abound for   carrying out and reporting original research. This may arise out of your every   day teaching and observation of classrooms; your awareness of new teaching   methods; or reflections on some of the literature you are reading. This may in   turn lead to an empirical study and / or desk-based research, such as a review   of the literature. <BR>
<BR>
There are obvious constraints in carrying out and   reporting on research. Higher education institutions put different priorities on   research and give different levels of support and encouragement. However   shortage of time affects everyone. Colleagues find different patterns for   managing their time; some need extended periods for reflection others can manage   regular short bursts of activity. <BR>
<BR>
A key challenge in writing for a   public audience is overcoming a lack of confidence and taking the risk of   opening your work to public scrutiny. In starting to write about ICT you are   switching roles from being a reader or user of research to being a writer or   producer of research. There might be a neat parallel between your doubts and   uncertainties about writing and those that your trainee teachers feel about   teaching. To meet the challenge you may want to think about phasing your entry   as a writer, for example setting your sights first on a professional journal or   a less formal publication such as the ITTE newsletter . When it comes to writing   for an academic publication you might want to start by co-authoring a paper with   a more experienced colleague who can explain the conventions and the process   more clearly. Another approach is to write a much shorter article, as a research   note, for an academic journal. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Writing processes</strong><BR>
Everyone   has their own ideas about writing and the routines that work for them. Some   people like to plan in a very detailed fashion, some like to structure their   text as they go along, some prefer to read around a topic in great depth before   writing, some go further into the literature once they have a better idea of the   direction in which they are heading. <BR>
<BR>
There are some general steps to   take which most of us find helpful. First, rehearse your ideas before you try to   commit yourself to writing an academic paper, for example discuss your research   with a critical friend - someone who is positive and supportive about your   efforts but prepared to point out the areas to develop. Your critical friend   need not be familiar with your particular research but they should know about   carrying out and reporting on educational research in general. As part of the   rehearsal phase, offer to present an informal seminar to your colleagues and if   appropriate invite your students to comment. <BR>
<BR>
Your next step may be to   take your ideas to a conference, for example the ITTE research conference,   usually held in Cambridge in January, or the ITTE annual conference, usually   held in July (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.itte.org.uk/index.php?id=13" target="blank">http://www.itte.org.uk/index.php?id=13</A>). Do not wait until the   research is polished. Your audience will be interested in having a few issues   and dilemmas clearly spelt out &ndash; avoid long, detailed descriptions which will   lose your listeners. Following feedback you will want to re draft your paper.   Writing involves repeated revision as you come to see how you can express more   clearly or realise other avenues on which to report. <BR>
<BR>
A particularly   important step to take is to consider the particular journal in which to publish   (see the journals listed on this site in the section <A href="text_only2016.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=6&tp=0&ts=2">refereed   academic research</A>). Read the aims of the journal very closely and spend some   time looking at back issues, in particular search for papers on similar themes   to your own. Most articles will follow a broadly similar format: abstract,   introduction, methodology, results, discussion. Many first time writers and   readers of academic research are struck by the importance given to literature   review and extensive referencing. This can result in pedantry, particularly when   a host of names are brought in to seek support for what seems obvious. However,   referencing allows the reader to see where your work fits into a body of   knowledge. This really is central; your audience is interested in the big   picture and the implications of your work for the research field, not the   immediate recommendations for practice in your institution. <BR>
<BR>
A second   feature which strikes many new academics is the attention given to methodology   and theoretical perspective. In contrast, books and papers aimed at   practitioners rarely deal in detail with how the data was collected and methods   of interpretation but this is a crucial part of academic writing. A third   striking feature of academic articles is the conciseness of the writing, the   author is often distilling findings from a much larger body of work. <BR>
<BR>
As   you work and re work your paper for an academic journal you will eventually   reach saturation point. You can certainly develop your paper further but in   doing so you realise you stand to lose as much as you gain. Get feedback on your   final draft, get it proof read and send it off. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>Peer   review</strong><BR>
You may as a writer on ICT be satisfied in publishing your work on   your own web, or in practitioner journals or more ambitiously in a book aimed at   teachers of ICT. However, there is a special status in many universities in   publishing in academic journals as papers are seen as validated by peer review   and contributing to a body of established thinking about your subject. Peer   reviews are there to ensure rigour and reviewers are giving up their time as a   contribution to the research community. Good advice is to step back from   whatever preconceptions you have about the peer review process, and, whether   accepted or rejected, reflect on the feedback and move on. <BR>
<BR>
The journal   editor will decide on the basis of reviewer comments to accept, reject or ask   you to amend your paper. Outright acceptance is very gratifying but relatively   rare and leaves you nothing more to do but to wait for the proofs of your   article and bask in your new status as an established contributor to the   academic community. It is more usual that you will be asked to make minor or   major amendments to your paper. If the amendments are significant there may be   no guarantee of publication at the end. <BR>
<BR>
New authors sometimes feel they   have to act on all the suggestions reviewers make for change. This is not the   case. If you want to stick by your original position explain why you have done   so to the editor. Inevitably your paper maybe rejected - many are and all   academics have suffered rejection at some time. Rejection may leave you angry   and suspicious of the process. Take time to reflect on the reasons for   rejection. If you still have faith in your paper send it elsewhere - once having   tailored it to fit the aims of another journal. Otherwise put the paper to one   side; when you are ready you will return to the ideas contained in it and you   may want to re work it some day. <BR>
<BR>
Embarking on academic research is an   uncertain enterprise. Like most things you do, you will get better with time,   that is providing you receive the right support. The profession needs writers -   stick with it. <BR>
<BR>

<H1>Supervision</H1>
<BR>
<strong>Supervising research and being supervised   yourself</strong><BR>
<BR>
One aspect of your role as tutor in a higher education   institution (HEI) is teaching and supervising higher degree research students.   As with taking on the role of PGCE tutor in the first place this presents both   opportunities and challenges. This section looks at supervising research   students, particularly those at doctorate level, but much will be relevant to   the supervision of students at Masters degree level. It covers:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Supervision skills and benefits<BR>
  Difficulties in research   supervision<BR>
  Student support opportunities<BR>
  Further   reading<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
A further section looks at issues to consider in   registering for a research degree and the process of being supervised   yourself.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Supervision skills and benefits</strong><BR>
<BR>
Good advice is to   start with a positive attitude to the process; supervision can be one of the   most stimulating and enjoyable aspects of teaching in higher education. It gives   you the opportunity to go into your subject in greater depth and perhaps to   share aspects of your own research and to see the work you have carried out   through the eyes of another. There is an altruistic satisfaction in helping   another person get started on their research and achieve something with your   critical support which they could not do otherwise. Supervision can add variety   to your work, may form part of your job description and any enthusiasm you show   for research supervision will usually be recognised by others. <BR>
<BR>
Before   looking at the difficulties in research supervision remind yourself of the   generic skills you bring: an ability to listen, experience in, and by now an   almost instinctive feel for, the importance of planning, setting realistic   manageable tasks, recording progress and balancing praise with constructive   criticism. Your own experiences of academic study will also help you carry out   your role.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Difficulties in research   supervision</strong><BR>
<BR>
<em>Overcoming self-doubt</em><BR>
As with any new role you   take on you will experience a range of challenges and difficulties, for example:
<UL>
  <LI>You feel you don&rsquo;t have enough experience of the subject area   
  <LI>You out feel out of your depth academically   
  <LI>You lack experience of the specific approach your student wants to follow. </LI>
</UL>
Sensible advice here is to take advantage of whatever training   opportunities your institution and your department offers. Many departments will   have mentoring arrangements or opportunities to co-supervise a student with a   more experienced colleague. <BR>
<BR>
<em>Relevant expertise</em><BR>
In working with   students state clearly what support and help you can offer but be open about   your lack of experience. You may be supervising a student even if you lack a   doctorate or Masters degree of your own, your student will judge you on the   support you offer them, not on your academic career. If you lack the background   to address specific concerns then put your student in contact with colleagues   who can advise or point them to relevant literature &ndash; this is standard practice   in most departments. <BR>
<BR>
<em>Student attitudes and behaviour</em><BR>
You may   experience a range of further difficulties from aspects of your students&rsquo;   attitudes and behaviour, eg.
<UL>
  <LI>Your student seems unaware of what is expected of a dissertation  
  <LI>Your student has specific language difficulties   
  <LI>Your student seems to have poor writing skills   
  <LI>Your student has writer&rsquo;s block   
  <LI>Your student expects too much of you and wants you to do it for them   
  <LI>Your student does not seem to want your help or input at all </LI>
</UL>
Good   generic advice is to set out your expectations clearly, for example, how often   you will meet for supervision, at what times, how long you can spend on reading   and commenting on drafts and the level of detail you are prepared to go into.   Make a record of what is discussed at each meeting and encourage your student to   set a target for the next meeting. If you have worries over your student&rsquo;s   progress try to understand the difficulties and set realistic goals to overcome   them. For example, the <BR>
student who is overwhelmed by carrying out a   literature survey might find it easier to get started by carrying out a critique   of a single paper. <BR>
<BR>
<em>Refining research targets</em><BR>
Many students   start with over ambitious targets for their research (eg the influence of ICT on   teaching and learning) and can be encouraged to focus down (eg a case study of   adoption of ICT in a single department). Here the discipline of writing out a   research proposal complete with timetable for each phase of the research and   carrying out a pilot study can be very helpful. <BR>
<BR>
<em>Expectations at   higher degree level</em><BR>
Students may have a very incomplete idea of what is   expected at doctorate or masters level; refer them to departmental guidelines.   Try to exemplify key statements and encourage students to read dissertations   others have done. However, avoid making predictions concerning how your students   will be marked &ndash; at Masters level grades need to be moderated by an exam board   and a doctoral candidate faces examination by an internal and external examiner.   You are not in a position to predict with certainty the decisions made by these   colleagues. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>Student support opportunities</strong><BR>
<BR>
<em>Student   training and support</em><BR>
Make sure your student is taking advantage both of   optional and compulsory research training courses offered by the department or   faculty. Take advantage of wider support systems in your university, for   example, ICT services for courses and guides to say SPSS (Statistical Package   for the Social Sciences) or qualitative data analysis software, language support   departments particularly valuable for students with English as a foreign   language and whatever generic study skills courses offered by graduate studies   department or the students union. <BR>
<BR>
<em>Community of researchers</em><BR>
A   key support for you and your student is the community of researchers in your   institution. You will be helped considerably if there is a team of ICT   researchers in your department sharing ideas and communicating within an   informal and formal seminar programme. There might be a wider programme of   support and events open to researchers in the department as a whole. If you and   your student feel quite isolated in your interests within the department you can   compensate to some extent by organising events with another institution and   carrying out informal exchange with colleagues. <BR>
<BR>
<em>Research conferences   and organisations</em><BR>
No matter the strengths and weaknesses of your   department you will want to encourage research students to attend conferences,   such as <A href="external.html?link=http://www.itte.org.uk/" target="blank">ITTE&rsquo;s   research and conference events</A>. More generally, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.bera.ac.uk/" target="blank">British   Educational Research Association (BERA)</A> offers conferences and support for   new researchers in education. A good focus for many students is to present a   paper &ndash; you can help by offering to present a joint paper first time around. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>Being a student researcher yourself</strong><BR>
<BR>
If you do not have a   research degree yourself, and you want to carry out your own research into   teaching and learning with ICT, you will probably benefit from registering for a   taught Masters course leading to supervised doctorate research. <BR>
<BR>
In   registering for a Masters programme key considerations to weigh up will probably   be:
<UL>
  <LI>distance you need to travel to attend the institution (though if you are   comfortable with a distance learning approach, albeit with some face to face   events, this may be less of an issue);   
  <LI>the reputation of the programme (for example, do you know colleagues who   have followed the programme in the past who could pass on their experiences?);   
  <LI>and appropriateness for your needs (for example, a local HEI might provide   very good general programmes but offer very little on teaching and learning   ICT). </LI>
</UL>
Before making a final decision contact course coordinators   directly and discuss your needs and interests with them. Of course, cost is   another key consideration and if you are based in an HEI you will almost   automatically decide to register for a course in your own institution as long as   you are not being charged fees.<BR>
<BR>
In registering for doctorate supervision   (the first step here is generally being registered for an MPhil) you will face a   similar set of considerations: distance you need to travel to attend the   institution; the reputation both of taught research methods courses and your   proposed supervisor; and appropriateness for research into ICT. In many cases   research students often choose an institution before choosing a supervisor and   there are clearly good reasons for doing so. However you might want to be more   selective and approach a colleague whose work you know, this will be easier if   you can make face to face contact, for example at an ITTE or other conference   event, or perhaps have taken part in debates on discussion forums together. <BR>
<BR>
There have been past plans to prepare a registry of interests within the   ICT research community, look out for future developments here. Academic   background is of course an important but only one factor in choosing your   supervisor. You can access academic knowledge through journals and conferences,   your priority is for an approachable 'critical friend' providing you with   reliable support and encouragement. Discuss your needs and interest thoroughly   with your proposed supervisor and work on a detailed research proposal before   registering. This proposal will not only help you narrow down your research   question but communicate your background and interests to your supervisor. <BR>
<BR>
It is easy to see being supervised as the mirror image of the advice for   supervising discussed earlier. Set out the ground rules: when are you going to   meet; for how long; what feedback do you expect.? Make your own record of   meetings and set achievable targets at the end of each meeting. Write as you go   along and spend time looking at other theses. Try to understand the conventions   &ndash; you do not need to follow these conventions blindly but you do need to know   what they are and to explain why you are not following some. Take advantage of   wider support in the institution, attend seminars and suggest to your supervisor   that you might co-present work at conferences when appropriate. Good   luck!<BR>

<H1>Supporting an M level assignment at PGCE</H1>
<BR>
If you have a whole class   you are supporting in an M level assignment offer them a clear structure and   provide guidance in a booklet form or online. For example, many courses will set   action research projects (though in practice this may stop at reconnaissance of   opportunities and some very limited innovations) or mini curriculum   investigations. Explain the stages you want students to go through; set   deadlines for each stage; suggest word lengths for each stage. Let them know you   are flexible (assuming you are of course) but giving them a framework often   makes it easier for the student rather than more restrictive. <BR>
<BR>
You may   well want to restrict the number of topics and to provide back up readings of   web references for them. The key for the student is turning a general interest   into a set of questions to investigate and a strategy for doing this. For   example, here are two topics with questions and sub questions which students   have identified and a broad strategy suggested for addressing   them.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Topic: interactive white boards (IWB)</em><BR>
Question: How can   they be used more effectively?<BR>
Sub questions: what is more effective; how are   they used already; how do children respond to them<BR>
Strategy: survey of   literature and practice in school<BR>
<BR>
<em>Topic: creativity</em><BR>
Question:   How can I be more creative in my teaching?<BR>
Sub questions: What is creativity;   what models of creativity might I try to develop; how do pupils respond to more   creative approaches <BR>
Strategy: action research <BR>
<BR>
Both these examples   could become more manageable investigations if they were narrowed down further,   for example 'How can I be more creative in my teaching of 6th form students?' or   'How can they be used more effectively with my Y7 class?'.<BR>
<BR>
No matter what   the style of assignment it will need to include something about the literature   which we turn to on <A href="text_only62be.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=6&tp=2&ts=6">Supervising:the   literature</A>.<BR>

<H1>Supervising: the literature</H1>
<BR>
There is a vast amount of literature on   teaching and learning &ndash; much more than students probably ever thought &ndash; but much   less on teaching ICT as a subject. They will need to use literature creatively.   For example, some of the literature may be about teaching a different subject   but is still relevant&ndash; though the student researcher should tell us why it   is:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"this study is about science teaching, however, the points they make   about practical experiments relate to my experiences of teaching ICT because ICT   is a similarly practical subject&hellip;."<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Other literature is general.   For example, there is a great deal about interactive white boards (IWB) but very   little about using the IWB in teaching ICT. It is fine for ICT students to use   this literature, but look to see if they are missing something about the context   in which we teach ICT. Again, some of the literature may relate to primary   schools, some to higher education. They may want to draw on this work, for   example Higher Education has probably been in the forefront of developing VLEs   as lecturers often deal with very large classes (200 students or more) and many   students who cannot physically attend campus. They will need to assess the   relevance of these accounts to supporting smaller classes of pupils learning ICT   in secondary schools. <BR>
<BR>
There are different types of literature which   carry a different status. For example, academic journals and professional   resources, and what we often call &lsquo;grey literature&rsquo;, such as online reports on   particular projects. They should be able to identify where the sources they use   belong and to reflect on the authorship of articles &ndash; do authors have a special   position which means they are likely to stress the benefits more than the   drawbacks of a particular approach? <BR>
<BR>
Writing about what literature tells   us is an art. Your students&rsquo; job is to describe briefly what the author has   said, to indicate what kind of study was carried out and comment on what was   said. For example, here one student summarises a comment from an article she had   read:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Glover and Miller (2004) in a study of science and MFL teachers,   identify three stages in the use of IWB (or IAWs as they called them at the   time): the first to support everyday classroom teaching; the second to stimulate   interactivity with the class; the third is to use the IWB to present the lesson   in new ways. "<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This student has summarised a longer point quite   succinctly and provided a comment on it. As the student reads more articles they   may want to organise their review around themes. For example, this student   introduces her review of VLEs and highlights that she will write about   opportunities, difficulties and conclusions:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"In this first section I will report on what has been said about the   advantages of VLEs and the opportunities they offer both teachers and students.   These cover issues such as storage, interaction and assessment. In the second   section I will look at the difficulties teachers and students have with VLEs and   these cover technical access and preferred styles of teaching and learning.   Finally, I will summarise the two sections and argue that VLEs seem to have a   limited but important potential for ICT departments."<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In   reviewing articles students may want to quote key phrases or particularly   striking ideas. They should use quotes selectively and not leave them to stand   alone, in other words: Quote - Explain &ndash; Critique. This student gives the quote,   explains its importance and offers a view of her own:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Loveless (2007, p 1) argues 'creativity can be regarded as not only   a quality found in exceptional individuals, but also as an essential life skill   through which people can develop their potential to use their imagination to   express themselves, and make original and valued choices in their lives.' <BR>
  This shows that creativity is a much wider concept than making or performing   art. A difficulty, however, is that creativity has become so wide a concept that   it could cover almost any context in which learners are engaged in   learning."<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
As students carry out reading, they should look for   similarity and difference between what different writers have said. Key phrases   for bringing together themes in the research are:<BR>
<BR>
A consistent theme of   the papers is that &hellip;.<BR>
An often reported difficulty is &hellip;..<BR>
Those arguing   against (VLEs) often suggest that &hellip;.<BR>
Implications for classroom use of (VLEs)   seem to be&hellip;..<BR>
The case for (formative assessment) clearly rests   on&hellip;.<BR>
<BR>
Students might also report on the extent of literature and some of   the difficulties encountered in getting hold of articles. For example, this   student discussed problems in the literature on VLEs: <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"As the use of VLEs in school, and their use in the teaching of ICT   in particular, is a relatively new field there has not been a lot of literature   to access. There does not seem a great deal of consistency in the findings and   much of the work has been carried out by enthusiasts and we must be cautious in   accepting the findings."<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In addition to literature your   assignment will often ask the student teacher to carry out some <A href="text_only9993.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=6&tp=2&ts=7">data   collection</A>. <BR>
author: Michael Hammond<BR>
<H1>Supervising: collecting data<BR>
</H1>
<BR>
<strong>Collecting empirical data:   Interviews, survey and questionnaire</strong><BR>
<BR>
Many assignments give students   opportunities to find out what is happening in their school(s). This gives an   opportunity to contrast what the literature is saying with what teachers and   pupils are saying about a topic. This is really important; the literature is   often general or talking about contexts with which students are not familiar.   No-one knows your student&rsquo;s school, classes, pupils as well as your student and   the teachers who teach there. <BR>
<BR>
Collecting data may involve questionnaire   survey, interviews, observations, all of which are covered in research methods   books. The key here is to keep the investigation small scale &ndash; the study does   not need to be representative of the school but should show awareness of, and   explain sampling strategies. In many cases talking to all ICT teachers in a   school is quite feasible and the focus for the investigation might be the   department or, more narrowly, teaching at a particular key stage. Students   should make sure all references to school, teachers and pupils are anonymised in   their reporting and to keep anything told to them confidential. In their   reporting the student will need to say how they collected the data &ndash; a chat   rather than formal interview is fine but say it, then what they did with their   data. In this example a student teacher is looking at creativity in &lsquo;Blackberry&rsquo;   school:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;While working in Blackberry school I spoke with three teachers in   my department, one with a lot of experience of working in the school and two who   were relatively new to teaching. I carried half hour semi structured interviews   with each about creativity in ICT lessons. I asked what they they thought   creativity meant; how it was best developed and the difficulties they had   experience in developing creativity. I made notes of each interview and looked   for consistency and contrast within these notes.<BR>
  <BR>
  Regarding the first,   each teacher put a different meaning onto creativity. One associated it very   much with being practical and being &lsquo;arty&rsquo;. He felt &ldquo;most of the creativity gets   done in Drama and Art&rdquo;. The other two teachers referred to an in-service event   they had attended and saw it as much more about pupils making choices in their   learning. They contrasted creative approaches with rote learning. They were   worried about the lack of creativity in some classes. One said &ldquo;the coursework   should be creative but very often it is jumping through hoops, we need to look   at that&rdquo;. I could see that there was a difference in teachers&rsquo; understanding of   creativity and I need to explore this further&hellip;. &ldquo;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In the same   way if they have spoken to pupils tell us who they spoke to? Where did they   speak to them? What did they find out? Respect confidentiality and do not engage   in discussions of individual teachers. This student carried out a discussion on   assessment:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;I set up a short focus group with five pupils from my class. They   were Y8 s (three boys and two girls) and represented a range of ability. I asked   them what they saw as the value of assessment in ICT, what types of assessment   they found useful, what worries they had about assessment; and what suggestions   they had for me to develop assessment practice with them. This was a half hour   open ended discussion. I made notes about the meeting and looked for consistency   and contrast in these opinions. There was a much greater consensus between   pupils, given this was a focus group rather than a set of individual interviews.   On the first, they felt that the value of assessment was that it should let you   know &lsquo;how well you are doing&rsquo;. However in practice they felt   &hellip;.&rdquo;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
If students are carrying out observations make sure they   have thought about a &lsquo;protocol' to record their observations (e.g. at a minimum   three columns time, teacher activity, pupil activity) and have a clear question   in mind before they start. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>Summarising what they have found   out</strong><BR>
<BR>
Different students have done this in different ways. Some have   made a contrast between different sources of information as they have gone   along, some have tended to do this at the end. Some find a table format very   useful. For example, a student might create a table in which to summarise   findings from the literature and from the teachers and pupils to whom they had   spoken. This would make opportunities for triangulation and comparison of   different sources more explcit.<BR>

<BR>
<strong>Writing: Do&rsquo;s and Do not&rsquo;s</strong><BR>
<BR>
In no   particular order here are some do&rsquo;s and do not&rsquo;s in use in one   partnership<BR>
<BR>
&bull; Do write in full, do not use contractions. Write it is not   rather than it isn&rsquo;t; it cannot rather than it can&rsquo;t, I will rather than I&rsquo;ll;   do not rather than don&rsquo;t. <BR>
&bull; Do reference properly. You are an information   specialist and understand how consistent referencing of material is important   including full referencing for web resources. You should ensure your referencing   and bibliography follow the Harvard Referencing style. For examples go to the   library page at:<BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/main/help/guidespublications/bib_cit/" target="blank">www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/main/help/guidespublications/bib_cit/</A><BR>
&bull;   Do reflect on what you quote, explain why the point the author is making is   important for you, but be prepared to critique it. <BR>
&bull; Do use your   introduction to clearly outline what the problem is you are addressing and stick   to it. Do not begin by talking about IWBs and end up talking about   assessment.<BR>
&bull; Do organise your text into paragraphs (group of sentences with   a common theme, think about a minimum of 4 sentences to a paragraph.) Be   consistent, break each paragraph with a double line break. Do not put lots of   text together without a paragraph or be inconsistent with your breaking.<BR>
&bull; Do   look at the model assignments from last year; identify what makes them Masters   Level.<BR>
&bull; Do write in the first person where this fits naturally. For example,   &ldquo;this study is going to look at pupil behaviour in a Year 9 ICT lesson. I am   interested in behaviour in Year 9 as I have observed so far that this is the   year group that is most challenging of authority and teacher instructions.&rdquo; Do   not use convoluted constructions such as &ldquo;in the opinion of the   researcher&hellip;&rdquo;<BR>
&bull; Do get someone to proof read your work and ask them to check   your apostrophes, punctuation, spelling and typos. You cannot proof read your   own work properly. Do not hand your assignment in before someone has done this   for you. Check your use of it&rsquo;s (it is), its (possessive); students (they); a   student&rsquo;s (his / her); students&rsquo; (their).<BR>
&bull; Do read through your text for   meaning. Use short sentences where you can and keep it simple. Avoid clumsy or   redundant phrases. For example, this is long winded and clumsy:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Open ended questioning within a class environment would allow the   teacher to find out and collect evidence for what pupils know and understand   about a topic and, more than this, allows for pupils&rsquo; misconceptions to be made   clear to everyone and to be highlighted by the teacher asking the   questions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The same idea is expressed more clearly as:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Open ended questioning allows the teacher to find out what pupils   know. Moreover it can give insight into pupils&rsquo; misconceptions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
&bull; Do   attend any special writing sessions, do not underestimate what is involved<BR>
&bull;   Do be creative in your use of literature, do not ignore literature if it is not   specifically about ICT.<BR>
&bull; Do &lsquo;buddy up&rsquo; with someone on the course, read each   other&rsquo;s work and offer feedback, do not keep your writing to yourself.<BR>
&bull; Do   put it in your own words (unless you are quoting), do not copy from an article   and not acknowledge it. Do not think plagiarism will go unnoticed. <BR>
