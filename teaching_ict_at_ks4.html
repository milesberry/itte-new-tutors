<H2>Teaching ICT at Key Stage 4</H2>
<p><br>
  Key stage 4 is defined as the education of pupils in years 10 and 11 (aged 14 - 16 years) and is characterised by having a small range of compulsory subjects of the National Curriculum and pupils being given choices from a limited number of options. Most subjects are taught through courses that are summatively assessed by examination and/or coursework. The courses, examinations and awards are validated by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) and are structured within the National Qualifications Framework (NQF).<br><br>The 14-19 Agenda is having a significant influence upon the nature of the curriculum in many schools. There is also the influence of the introduction of Functional Skills in literacy, numeracy and ICT. The National Curriculum can be provided through activities taking place across the curriculum (ICTAC).<br><br>The nature of pupils' experience at key stage 4 is consequently varied within and between schools. Consequently, trainees may experience a range of provision (or none at all!) at key stage 4.<br><br>Good starting points:<br><br>14-19 Strategy <a href="external.html?link=http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/14-19" target="blank">http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/14-19</a><br><br>Functional Skills <a href="external.html?link=http://www.qca.org.uk/qca_6062.aspx" target="blank">http://www.qca.org.uk/qca_6062.aspx</a><br><br>ICTAC <a href="external.html?link=http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/secondary/keystage3/all/respub/ictac" target="blank">http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/secondary/keystage3/all/respub/ictac</a><br><br>National Curriculum ICT <a href="external.html?link=http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/key-stages-3-and-4" target="blank">http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/key-stages-3-and-4</a><br><br>National Qualifications Framework <a href="external.html?link=http://www.qca.org.uk/libraryAssets/media/qca-06-2298-nqf-web.pdf" target="blank">http://www.qca.org.uk/libraryAssets/media/qca-06-2298-nqf-web.pdf</a><br><br>QCA <a href="external.html?link=http://www.qca.org.uk/" target="blank">http://www.qca.org.uk</a> <br><br>QCF <a href="external.html?link=http://www.qca.org.uk/qca_8150.aspx" target="blank">http://www.qca.org.uk/qca_8150.aspx</a><br><br>TeacherNet <a href="external.html?link=http://publications.teachernet.gov.uk/" target="blank">http://publications.teachernet.gov.uk</a><br><br>The following pages include:<br><br>

</UL>
<p><BR>
  <strong>OCR Nationals </strong><BR>
<BR>
The OCR Nationals are an   exam-free alternative to GCSEs aiming for a more engaging, practical approach to   learning and assessment. They are presented at Level 1, 2 and 3 and there is a   pathway of study through a number of vocational areas including ICT. The OCR   Level 1 Nationals are aimed primarily at 14-16 year olds and include a range of   ICT themes and generic activities in the areas of team working, career planning,   communication and problem solving.<BR>
<BR>
At level 2 they are structured to   enable schools to offer the GCSE equivalent of 1, 2, 3 or 4 passes at A*-C with   a suggested guided learning time (teacher-led classroom activity) of 90 hours   per GCSE equivalent.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
National First Award 1 GCSE (A* -   C)<BR>
National Award 2 GCSEs (A* - C)<BR>
National First Certificate 3 GCSEs (A*   - C)<BR>
National Certificate 4 GCSEs (A* - C)<BR>
<BR>
The level 3 awards   are presented as Certificate, Diploma and Extended Diploma and are equivalent to   1, 2 or 3 A levels respectively with an indicative "guided learning hours" of   360 per A level equivalent.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>GNVQ &ndash; alternatives and   successors</strong><BR>
<BR>
GNVQ Part One - last award 2004 and superseded with   revision by Applied GCSE (double award)<BR>
<BR>
ICT GNVQ &ndash; removed from 2007 <BR>
<BR>
Post-16 VCE redesigned as GCE in Applied ICT (from   2005)<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Digital Applications</strong><BR>
<BR>
From 2005 the GNVQ equivalent   awards are in Digital Applications provided by Edexcel with 3 options (outlined   below) AiDA, CiDA and DiDA.<BR>
<BR>
DiDA was produced as a replacement for GNVQ   ICT. The majority of the students who took GNVQ ICT were aged 14-16 with most   completing the course over two years in Years 10 and 11 or in a growing number   of cases where schools move Key Stage 4 teaching into Year 9, over three years.   The Diploma award (DiDA) has 4 GCSE sized units (equivalent to a GCSE both in   terms of worth and in the amount of time and resources it needs). It is normal   for a GCSE to be given about 10% of curriculum time (approximately two hours a   week) in Years 10 and 11. Unit 1 covers material that is generic to all units   such as project planning, e-portfolio building, and prototyping and is   compulsory as all other units build upon it. On successful completion of that   unit students can claim the Award in Digital Applications (1 GCSE) and then can   &ldquo;top up&rdquo; their portfolios to achieve the larger qualifications. Students do not   have to have passed Unit 1 before moving on and subsequent units can be studied   in any order. The Certificate CiDA (2 GCSEs) is Unit 1 plus one other unit   requiring 3 to 4 hours a week over 2 years. The Diploma DiDA (4 GCSEs) is Unit 1   plus three other units requiring 5-6 hours a week over 2 years or 12 hours a   week for one year.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Post-16 Opportunities in ICT related   subjects</strong><BR>
<BR>
Between 2003 and 2005 enrolments for the full course GCSE   ICT and the short course GCSE increased by nearly a fifth with female candidates   outnumbering male candidates on the short courses. However, in post-16 education   the numbers of students electing to follow courses for GCE A and AS in ICT and   in Computing continue to fall. This fall is particularly noticeable in GCE   Computing (27% decrease over 2 years). The pass rates (candidates gaining A&ndash;E)   rose by 1.1 per cent for A level ICT and 2 per cent for A level Computing from   between 2003&ndash;05 figures. (This contrasts with the falling pass rate in the GCSE   courses.)<BR>
<BR>
QCA is responsible for the AS and A level subject criteria that   set out the knowledge, understanding, skills and assessment objectives common to   all AS and A level specifications in a given subject. They provide the framework   within which the awarding body creates the detail of the specification. These   subject criteria are intended to help ensure consistent and comparable standards   in the same subject across the awarding bodies.<BR>

<H1>Other qualifications and awards in ICT</H1>
<p><BR>
  <strong>Vendor   Awards</strong><BR>
<BR>
Microsoft, Cisco and Macromedia, for example, provide a range   of user qualifications. They are not standalone within the National   Qualifications Framework but, because they are being used by many schools, are   seen to be acceptable assessments and qualifications. They can be integrated   with other awards so adding extra value to the students&rsquo; examination portfolio,   perhaps meeting local needs.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>British Computer Society</strong><BR>
<BR>
BCS   IT User Certificate Level 2 (inc ECDL) <A href="external.html?link=http://www.bcsituser.org/" target="blank">http://www.bcsituser.org</A> <BR>

The International Baccalaureate   Organization Diploma Programme, created in 1968, is a pre-university course of   study that leads to examinations. It is designed for secondary school students   aged 16 to 19. In December 2003 QCA published a report comparing standards in A   levels with the International Baccalaureate (IB). (Report on Comparability   between GCE and International Baccalaureate Examinations). The findings   &lsquo;broadly, were that A level and IB examinations were comparable in the demands   they placed on candidates at the level of the individual subject. <A href="external.html?link=http://www.qca.org.uk/qca_9911.aspx" target="blank">http://www.qca.org.uk/qca_9911.aspx</A><BR>

<H1>The National Curriculum for ICT</H1>
<BR>
This section contains an outline of   the National Curriculum for ICT at key stage 4. It was first published by QCA in   2007 and comes into force in schools from September 2008. The claim is that the   new National Curriculum will provide:
<UL>
  <LI>Greater flexibility and coherence  
  <LI>New focus on aims and skills  
  <LI>Greater personalisation through assessment and qualifications  
  <LI>Greater coherence through a common structure across all   subjects</LI>
</UL>
Greater flexibility and coherence is achieved through   tailoring learning to the learners&rsquo; needs by having less prescribed subject   content. Pupils will still be taught essential subject knowledge but the new   curriculum balances subject knowledge with the key concepts and processes that   underlie the discipline of each subject.<BR>
<BR>
The revised programmes of study   for all subjects share a common format which includes:
<UL>
  <LI>an importance statement &ndash; why the subject matters.  
  <LI>key concepts &ndash; identifies the big ideas that underpin the subject  
  <LI>key processes &ndash; identifies the essential skills of the subject  
  <LI>range and content &ndash; outlines the breadth of subject matter</LI>
</UL>
The   curriculum is described in terms of knowledge, concepts and skills. A further   section identifies opportunities to enhance and enrich learning, including   making links to the wider curriculum such as enterprise, creativity, and   cultural understanding and diversity.<BR>
<BR>
What has changed and why is   summarised in the document <A href="external.html?link=http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/uploads/overview_doc_tcm8-1839.pdf" target="blank">http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/uploads/overview_doc_tcm8-1839.pdf</A><BR>
<BR>
The   complete programme of study for ICT key stage 4 is available from <A href="external.html?link=http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/key-stages-3-and-4/subjects/index.aspx" target="blank">http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/key-stages-3-and-4/subjects/index.aspx</A>.<BR>
<BR>
The   importance of information and communication technology is...<BR>
<BR>
The   increasing use of technology in all aspects of society makes confident, creative   and productive use of ICT an essential skill for life. ICT capability   encompasses not only the mastery of technical skills and techniques, but also   the understanding to apply these skills purposefully, safely and responsibly in   learning, everyday life and employment. ICT capability is fundamental to   participation and engagement in modern society. <BR>
<BR>
ICT can be used to find,   develop, analyse and present information, as well as to model situations and   solve problems. ICT enables rapid access to ideas and experiences from a wide   range of people, communities and cultures, and allows pupils to collaborate and   exchange information on a wide scale. ICT acts as a powerful force for change in   society and citizens should have an understanding of the social, ethical, legal   and economic implications of its use, including how to use ICT safely and   responsibly. Increased capability in the use of ICT supports initiative and   independent learning, as pupils are able to make informed judgements about when   and where to use ICT to enhance their learning and the quality of their   work.<BR>
