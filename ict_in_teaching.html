<H2>ICT in teaching</H2>
<br>This page gives an overview of the affordances provided by use of technology in teaching and the influences these have on pedagogy. The contexts for these uses include the use in teaching in the classroom and for teachers' own CPD. The use of technology and its relationship to the standards is discussed and, at the foot of the page, there is a list of useful resources for tutors and trainees.<br><br>Information and communication technology (ICT) is more than just another teaching tool. Increasingly the evidence suggests that ICT has the potential to improve the quality and standards of pupils' education. The <a href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/partners/quality/ict.aspx" target="blank">TDA recognises</a> its considerable potential for supporting teachers, both in their everyday classroom role and in their continuing training and development. <br><br>This statement encapsulates the importance of ICT for teachers. This importance is also manifest in the <a href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/upload/resources/pdf/q/qts_itt_req.pdf" target="blank">standards for QTS</a>, which include ICT in both professional knowledge and understanding and in professional skills:<br><ul><li>Q16: Have passed the professional skills tests in numeracy, literacy and  information and communications technology (ICT).</li><li>Q17: Know how to use skills in literacy, numeracy and ICT to support their  teaching and wider professional activities.  </li><li>Q23: Design opportunities for learners to develop their literacy, numeracy and  ICT skills. </li><li>Q25 (a): Teach lessons and sequences of lessons across the age and ability range for which they are trained in which they use a range of teaching strategies and resources, including e-learning, taking practical account of diversity and promoting equality and inclusion.</li></ul>Thus, to be successful, trainees need to develop their own use of ICT and ways to enable their learners to do the same.<br><br>Trainees need to learn how to create effective learning and teaching environments, even though resources will differ from school to school. This  makes it necessary for tutors to not only talk about ICT in the classroom but also to model best practice by demonstrating different ways in which technology can enhance the delivery of ICT. This applies to all subjects including ICT itself – simply because a trainee is teaching ICT does not mean that their ability to make effective use of technology for learning and teaching can be taken as read. The methods used to deliver ICT through ICT by tutors should enable trainee teachers to integrate ICT within their teaching and provide opportunities for them to use the technologies they will encounter in school.<br><br>Tutors should make effective use of this range of technologies both hardware- and software-based. These will include wireless and portable devices, learning platforms, digital multimedia creativity tools and Web 2.0 environments for collaboration, e-portfolios and personal web spaces. Within the context of the school environment, trainee teachers will be required to make effective use of this wide range of resources and preparation for these experiences must be systematically addressed.<br><br>Tutors, in order to provide for the need of their trainees, need to be aware of the current thinking about good practice. They should also have knowledge and understanding of relevant research so they can support the needs of the trainees.<br><br>The TDA has produced <a href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/upload/resources/pdf/g/guidelines_on_good_practice_and_ict_provision_for_trainee_teachers.pdf" target="blank">guidance</a> on best practice for ITT providers in the provision of ICT.

<H1>Purposes for using ICT</H1>
<BR>
This page considers some of the purposes for   using ICT in the classroom and with trainees. <BR>
<UL>
  <LI>creativity  
  <LI>motivation  
  <LI>concept development  
  <LI>assessment for learning  
  <LI>collaborative learning  
  <LI>multisensory representation  
  <LI>personalisation  
  <LI>learning outside the classroom.</LI>
</UL>
These purposes have been chosen for   the impact they have on learning and teaching both in schools and with trainees.   For each of the purposes listed above, there is a short discussion of the key   issues for ICT tutors and resources for further reading.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>ICT and   creativity</strong><BR>
<BR>
The National Advisory Committee for Creative and Cultural   Education (NACCCE) <A href="external.html?link=http://www.dfes.gov.uk/naccce" target="blank">report</A> offers a definition of creativity that has four   facets:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>thinking or behaving imaginatively  
  <LI>activity that is purposeful   
  <LI>generation of an original artefact  
  <LI>outcomes that have value</LI>
</UL>
These four facets are reflected in much   that the ICT curriculum offers. Through its focus on purpose and audience, the   effective use of ICT provides opportunities for pupils to generate imaginative   solutions that yield original products of value to the intended audience.   Trainee teachers could reflect on these four when planning lesson objectives and   outcomes. Creativity is also fundamental to allowing pupils to explore ideas and   to develop authentic learning activities, something that <A href="external.html?link=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4964296663335083307" target="blank">Ken Robinson</A>, former chair of NACCCE, argues schools may not   always allow as a matter of course.<BR>
<BR>
To assist with the embedding of   creativity in the curriculum, the QCA has a <A href="external.html?link=http://www.ncaction.org.uk/creativity" target="blank">minisite</A> dedicated to creativity. This offers advice on   promoting creativity during the planning, teaching and reviewing stages. Further   advice came from Loveless in her report on <A href="external.html?link=http://www.futurelab.org.uk/download/pdfs/research/lit_reviews/Creativity_Review.pdf" target="blank">the impact of ICT in creativity</A> for Futurelab and its section   on implications for practice has many ideas that are still current. This report   was one of the bases for the <A href="external.html?link=http://ttrb.ac.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?ContentId=12746" target="blank">TDA/Microsoft Futures Forum</A> on ICT and Creativity, part of a   three-year UK initiative focused on a programme of activities to help teachers,   trainee teachers and the wider school workforce become confident in the use of   ICT.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>ICT, motivation and engagement</strong><BR>
<BR>
Much research has been   carried out into the link between the use of ICT, motivation and engagement of   learners. <BR>
<BR>
A <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/upload-dir/downloads/page_documents/research/wtrs_motivation.pdf" target="blank">report from Becta</A> summarises the key findings and suggests   resources for further reading. The report highlights that there is substantial   evidence that ICT can have a positive effect on students&rsquo; enjoyment and interest   in learning. Key benefits identified in the report are:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>increased commitment to the learning task  
  <LI>increased independence and motivation for self-directed study  
  <LI>enhanced self-esteem and improved behaviour.</LI>
</UL>
Passey, Rogers et al&rsquo;s <A href="external.html?link=http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR523new.pdf" target="blank">research</A> for the DfES identifies a number of ways in which the   use of ICT has motivational effects on learners. These include positive impacts   on both in-school and out-of-school learning.<BR>
<BR>
ICT tutors should encourage   trainee teachers to reflect on this research to exploit this intrinsic   motivational aspect of their subject. Adults and children alike have an   intrinsic motivation to progress and the use of ICT offers unique opportunities   to learners and teachers to enhance classroom practices and to change attitudes   and behaviours. The use of ICT is, of course, not a panacea. ICT when delivered   in a dull way does not help to encourage and develop student motivation. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>ICT and concept development</strong><BR>
<BR>
Is the most effective use of   ICT about doing existing things differently or doing completely different   things? Cox and Webb's <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/upload-dir/downloads/page_documents/research/ict_pedagogy_summary.pdf" target="blank">report on ICT and pedagogy</A> (2003) summarises the findings from   research:<BR>
<BR>
<em>The pedagogical practices of teachers using ICT can range   from only small enhancements of practices using what are essentially traditional   methods, to more fundamental changes in their approach to   teaching."</em><BR>
<BR>
When learners are developing their understanding of new   concepts, ICT may provide a new set of tools or approaches. These include, for   example, iterative development of ideas through redrafting, use of mind maps,   use of multimedia, collaborative authoring, modelling and the use of mobile and   e-learning to build opportunities for learning outside of the   classroom.<BR>
<BR>
Many of these approaches also make demands for different   teaching methods. The <A href="external.html?link=http://www.pelrs.org.uk/" target="blank">Developing Pedagogies for E-learning Resources</A> project provides   resources and case studies in this area. The other pages of this Teaching and   Learning section also provide ideas in specific phases of education <A href="text_only113b.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=0&tp=2&ts=1">Primary</A>, <A href="text_onlyfec3.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=3&ts=1">Key   Stage 3</A>, <A href="text_only15e6.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=4&ts=1">Key   Stage 4</A> and <A href="text_onlyd388.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=5&ts=1">14-19</A>.   Another section of this website summarises the <A href="text_onlyef50.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=6&tp=1&ts=3">research   into the pedagogy of ICT</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>ICT and Assessment</strong><BR>
<BR>
Through   the use of communication, data handling and presentation tools, ICT provides   opportunities for assessment and monitoring of pupil progress. Tutors should   explore these with trainees. Examples include<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Use of spreadsheets or other data handling tools for tracking progress  
  <LI>Use of data to analyse value added and expected levels of attainment based   on prior achievements  
  <LI>Use of VLEs for electronic submission of work and provision of formative   feedback through comments and annotation  
  <LI>Use of electronic portfolios for collation, presentation and submission of   work and for transfer between educational settings  
  <LI>Use of e-learning tools for e-assessment and diagnostics  
  <LI>Use of e-learning tools for peer review and e-mentoring</LI>
</UL>
Some of   these issues are discussed more fully in the <A href="text_only2d91.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=5&tp=0&ts=1">assessment</A> section of this website. A further resource on e-assessment is being produced   for this website during 2008.<BR>
<BR>
Some key resources include<BR>
<BR>
Black, P.   J. &amp; Wiliam, D. (1998). <em>Inside the black box: raising standards through   classroom assessment</em> London, UK: King's College London School of Education   (see the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/schools/sspp/education/research/groups/assess.html" target="blank">King's College Assessment website</A> for more   information).<BR>
<BR>
Futurelab's <A href="external.html?link=http://www.nestafuturelab.org/research/reviews/10_01.htm" target="blank">e-assessment literature review</A>.<BR>

<BR>
<strong>Collaborative learning</strong><BR>
<BR>
ICT   provides opportunities for learners to work together and produce a shared   outcome. Methods of doing this include<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Individuals working on sections of a presentation, report or multimedia that   are then combined  
  <LI>Shared review and redrafting  
  <LI>Use of wikis to develop shared content   
  <LI>Annotation of peers' work including the use of comments in blogs and   discussion forums.</LI>
</UL>
These ideas, as with others on this page, can   equally be applied to trainees as to pupils in schools. The use of a wiki for   example would allow trainees to jointly plan a lesson and prepare associated   resources. ICT allows for collaboration and the web-based wiki allows for this   to be done at a distance.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Multisensory representation</strong><BR>
<BR>
ICT   allows for ideas to be represented in a range of media. A presentation may be   made using text, which is complemented by an audio track. Videos can be   subtitled with text. Transcripts of audios can be provided.<BR>
<BR>
ICT provides   tools for the creation of <A href="text_onlyc1b7.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=10&ts=4">multimedia   products</A> and some of these allow for the embedding of different media. This   'media redundancy' allows not only for information to be made accessible to   pupils with specific needs but also provides choice to all students. It may well   be that, in some circumstances, pupils will understand a concept better if it is   presented visually. Or they may follow the concepts being presented in a video   if they have the transcript available for future   perusal.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Personalisation</strong><BR>
<BR>
Personalisation is a key aspect of   the Government's <A href="external.html?link=http://www.dfes.gov.uk/publications/e-strategy/docs/e-strategy.pdf" target="blank">Harnessing Technology strategy</A>. ICT supports the   personalisation of learning in a number of ways. These include<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Providing alternative versions of a resource or activity to match need  
  <LI>Providing alternative pathways through materials through guided feedback or   timed release on a VLE  
  <LI>Provision of supporting resources on a VLE for further study outside of the   classroom  
  <LI>Supporting opportunities for assessment for learning, as   above.</LI>
</UL>
Underwood et al's <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh&catcode=_re_rp_02&rid=14202" target="blank">Impact 2007 report</A> for Becta reports on the impact of   technology on personalisation. Some of the key findings include:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>In teachers&rsquo; perceptions, it is clear that ICT is strongly associated with   personalising learning.   
  <LI>Pupils&rsquo; perceptions of the level of personalisation of their learning are   linked to work ethos including self-efficacy.  
  <LI>Primary pupils with a greater opportunity to use ICT and also with more   positive attitudes towards computers recorded a more personalised learning   experience.  
  <LI>For both primary and secondary pupils, the learners&rsquo; overall experiences of   personalisation were associated with higher levels of pupil work ethos and   greater opportunities to use ICT.  
  <LI>Allowing content choice is the most frequent way of personalising the   learning experience. Learner goal-setting and self-monitoring is far less   prevalent.  
  <LI>Personalising learning is constrained by the National Curriculum.  
  <LI>Computer use and e-maturity are associated with personalising   learning.</LI>
</UL>
<p>(Underwood et al:2007:4-5)<BR>
  <BR>
  More detailed advice is   being developed for inclusion in this website for Easter   2009.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Learning outside the classroom</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  A VLE can make   resources, activities and feedback available outside of the classroom. Such uses   also allow for the development of home-school links as parents can be given   access to some of this information.<BR>
  <BR>
  ICT can also be utilised in other   situations beyond the school, for example, the collection of data on field trips   using mobile devices, the use of podcasts downloaded to MP3/MP4 players for   mobile learning and the exchange of information between settings such as work   placements or where learning takes place in more than one institution. <BR>

<H1>Resource management and learning platforms</H1>
<BR>
This page considers the   development of the use of technology for managing resources. Tutors should   enable trainees to develop their understanding of such tools and to have access   to their use both in the provider's centre and in placement schools. Topics   addressed on this page are:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Websites  
  <LI>Learning platforms, VLE and MLE  
  <LI>Content management   
  <LI>Curriculum mapping and planning  
  <LI>Learner access and administration  
  <LI>Communication tools</LI>
</UL>
<strong>Websites</strong><BR>
<BR>
Most schools will have a   website and trainees should be encouraged to discuss its use. The main purpose   of the website is to market the school to its community, and maybe to act as a   portal to other services such as the learning platform, weblogs or print   materials such as a prospectus.<BR>
<BR>
As the website is publicly available   there are considerations of e-safety. Becta&rsquo;s <A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=is&rid=9964" target="blank">guidelines on the safe use of school websites</A> highlights the   issues of ensuring privacy and safety in the use of images, weblogs, webcams,   etc. There are further issues to be considered if pupils are engaged in   maintaining the site.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Learning platforms, VLE and   MLE</strong><BR>
<BR>
<em>(See also the <A href="text_onlyf14f.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=2&ts=4">Primary   section of this website</A>)</em><BR>
<BR>
The learning platform is the key ICT   system to support learning, teaching and associated administration for a school   community. It is intrinsically &lsquo;inward-facing&rsquo;, supporting use by the existing   members of the school community. It will be complemented by the 'outward-facing'   school website, and the two may be fairly tightly linked through a portal with a   single URL.<BR>
<BR>
This page looks at learning platforms, their functionality   and impact on the needs of initial teacher training. <BR>
<BR>
Government targets   on the access of all pupils to online learning platforms have taken several   forms:<BR>
<BR>
&ldquo;Ensure every learner has appropriate access to technology in   school and beyond the normal school day. [by 2010]&rdquo; (<em><A href="external.html?link=http://www.dfes.gov.uk/publications/e-strategy/" target="blank">DfES e-strategy</A></em>)<BR>
<BR>
&ldquo;By spring 2008 every pupil should   have access to a personalised online learning space with the potential to   support an e-portfolio and by 2010 every school should have integrated learning   and management systems (a comprehensive suite of learning platform   technologies)&rdquo; (<A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=lv&catcode=ss_lv_lp_03&rid=12887" target="blank">"What is a learning platform"</A>, Becta). <BR>
<BR>
The   provision of such learning spaces is a key aspect of the personalisation agenda   (see also the <A href="text_only5a8d.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=10&ts=2">Purposes   for using ICT</A> page in this section). Underwood et al's <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh&catcode=_re_rp_02&rid=14202" target="blank">Impact 2007 Report</A> for Becta reports that where VLEs are   implemented well they support personalisation and provides case studies of their   use in this respect.<BR>
<BR>
The <A href="external.html?link=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/teachers/issue48/secondary/features/Virtuallearning/" target="blank">Government defines</A> &ldquo;learning platform&rdquo; as<BR>
<BR>
&ldquo;&hellip;an umbrella   term that describes a broad range of ICT systems used to deliver and support   learning and teaching. It usually combines several functions, such as   organising, mapping and delivering curriculum activities, and the facility for   learners and teachers to have a dialogue about the activity, all via ICT.&rdquo; <BR>
<BR>
Further, the definition states that the term learning platform &ldquo;may be   applied to a virtual learning environment (VLE) or to the components of a   managed learning environment (MLE). A VLE is a software tool which brings   together resources for curriculum mapping, delivery, assessment, tutor support,   communication and tracking. A managed learning environment (MLE) refers to the   whole range of information systems and processes that support learning and the   management of learning within an institution. It includes VLEs or other learning   platforms, administrative and other support systems.&rdquo;<BR>
<BR>
Learning platforms   are becoming more widespread in schools as well as in ITT organisations, so   trainee teachers will need to understand how they can make use of them to   develop and support their pupils&rsquo; learning. They should also be aware of the   Becta guidance on purchasing systems and the associated <A href="external.html?link=http://industry.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?resID=17320" target="blank">functionality checklists</A>. Local authority and school policies   on the implementation of learning platforms will be a key issue for many as they   move on to become subject leaders. Of particular interest is the debate between   proponents of open source and proprietary solutions with their different   relative cost models.<BR>
<BR>
There is a vast array of functionality and tools   that could be considered by trainee teachers. JISC&rsquo;s <A href="external.html?link=http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearning_framework.aspx/" target="blank">e-learning framework</A> provides a very comprehensive overview of   the landscape. It does this from the point of view of higher education and with   the emphasis on &lsquo;pure&rsquo; e-learning. As an aside, it is interesting that the   underlying technology of the JISC e-learning framework site is built on an open   source content management system (Plone). Trainees could usefully be made aware   of such products and their use in web and system design.<BR>
<BR>
From a schools&rsquo;   perspective, and with the assumption of classroom interactions to complement the   use of the platform, <A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=lv&catcode=ss_lv_lp_03&rid=12887" target="blank">Becta</A> identifies a range functions that would typically be   found in a learning platform:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Content management   
  <LI>Curriculum mapping and planning  
  <LI>Learner access and administration  
  <LI>Communication tools</LI>
</UL>
<p>Each of these functions will now be considered   in turn.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Content management</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  A learning platform is   essentially a collection of resources made available online. From a learning and   teaching perspective, many of these resources will be digital artefacts &ndash;   documents, multimedia, etc. To equate &lsquo;content&rsquo; with &lsquo;file&rsquo;, however, would be   to take a very narrow view. Even in the relatively early days of VLEs, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/jtap/jtap-041.pdf" target="blank">Britain and Liber</A>, writing for the Joint Information Systems   Committee (JISC), identified that &ldquo;Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) &hellip;   synthesise the functionality of computer-mediated communications &hellip; and on-line   methods of delivering course materials&rdquo; (p7). While this report was on the   higher education sector, this notion of synthesis of functions is a useful one.   The range of functions has increased over time and trainee teachers could be   encouraged to share experiences from the diversity of products and   implementations they encounter while in schools and colleges.<BR>
  <BR>
  While there   is a multiplicity of functionality available on any given learning platform   there will be also be a spectrum of usage of that functionality according to   individual teacher or subject. Some will use the learning platform merely as a   &lsquo;digital repository&rsquo; &ndash; storing files created on standard &lsquo;office&rsquo; software.   Others will use the interactive, collaborative and management tools to more   fully embed the platform in the learning of pupils. Trainee teachers need to   reflect on these continua and to explore how the particular demands of their   subject and the particular context in which they work will allow such   functionality to be exploited. <BR>
  <BR>
  Stephenson (2001) identifies another set   of axes when considering the nature of content. Here the originator of the   content becomes crucial. For some teachers, and trainees and tutors, the content   held on a learning platform is predominately created by themselves. For others,   at the other end of Stephenson&rsquo;s axis, the content is created by the pupils.   This echoes back to the nature of creativity in the use of ICT.<BR>
  <BR>
  Gillespie   et al (2007) address the use of learning platforms with and by trainee teachers.   They consider the range of &lsquo;content&rsquo; that may be deployed and have sharing,   collaboration and communication at the heart of this discussion. The use of the   learning platform for handling assessments &ndash; setting assignments, online   submission and feedback are all considered. Feedback here includes formative   assessment for learning and summative assessment of learning. Trainees should be   encouraged to develop proficiency in using online systems for providing both   types of feedback.<BR>
  <BR>
  Becta&rsquo;s <A href="external.html?link=http://industry.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?resID=17320" target="blank">functionality requirements</A> for learning platforms lists the   requirements for &lsquo;approved&rsquo; systems. Trainee teachers could evaluate the systems   they use against the requirements. These include the ability to handle content   for assessment purposes, for interoperability across systems and for   accessibility from a range of devices. <BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Curriculum mapping and   planning</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  A traditional view of curriculum mapping and planning may be   that it is something that is done by the teacher and perhaps only fleetingly   shared with pupils through handouts at the start, and at key points, of a   course. The use of a learning platform provides opportunities to involve the   pupils in this mapping and to provide elements of personalisation and   differentiation while doing so. It also provides opportunity for plans and   resources to be shared across a group of teachers. <BR>
  <BR>
  The very nature of   the medium of the learning platform &ndash; the web browser &ndash; provides a number of   intrinsic opportunities for this &lsquo;sharing&rsquo; of the curriculum map and plan. Web   pages do not need to be structured linearly, they can be hyperlinked together   and users can determine their own paths. Content can be assembled and   reassembled in different combinations to suit different needs. <BR>
  <BR>
  More   straightforwardly the way in which a course is presented online may reinforce   its structure and internal plan so as to reinforce key learning across the   course. The online space is less transient than materials handed out week by   week. It allows pupils to return again and again to the same content (whether   static files or collaborative activities) and to see them in relation to other   aspects of the course. This has implications for course design &ndash; both in terms   of planning and of design and use of resources. Trainee teachers should   investigate the ways in which courses are planned and presented on learning   platforms, and how they are used by different groups of pupils. The Becta <A href="external.html?link=http://industry.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?resID=17320" target="blank">requirements</A> for this aspect include issues of accessibility,   personalisation and navigation. These may provide a framework for   evaluation.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Learner access and administration</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  As above, a   learning platform may encompass elements of managed learning environments, which   in turn may be linked to, or subsume, management information systems. These   systems provide access to tracking data on usage of the electronic resources and   on the progress of pupils through the school. <A href="external.html?link=http://industry.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?resID=17320" target="blank">Typical examples</A> cited by Becta include attendance tracking,   assessment monitoring, user account management and authentication, security and   permissions, scheduling, timetabling, management of portfolios and usage data.   Data entry to these systems may be through a teacher&rsquo;s laptop, PDA or swipe   card.<BR>
  <BR>
  These functions rely on a number of underlying databases and ICT   trainees could use this context to deepen their understanding of data. If   possible, they should be given opportunities not only to set up resources for   courses, but to manage user accounts for differentiated access. They should   understand the design of different levels of permissions for different roles &ndash;   pupil, teacher, administrator.<BR>
  <BR>
  It is also essential that they make use of   data from the systems to assist with their planning. This would provide evidence   for <A href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/upload/resources/pdf/q/qts_itt_req.pdf" target="blank">QTS standard</A> Q13 &ldquo;Know how to use local and national   statistical information to evaluate the effectiveness of their teaching, to   monitor the progress of those they teach and to raise levels of   attainment&rdquo;.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Communication tools</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  As noted above the   learning platform is a collaborative, interactive space. Content is created by   all users and shared amongst them. There are a range of communication tools that   may be provided &ndash; wikis, blogs, forums, chat etc - and these are considered in   more detail in <A href="text_only4023.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=10&ts=6">Software   for collaboration</A> on this website.<BR>
  <BR>
  The learning platform may also   incorporate a standard e-mail system. There are issues of privacy and workload   to consider when pupils are in personal contact with teachers by e-mail.   Trainees should be encouraged to discuss these issues, as <A href="external.html?link=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3995699.stm" target="blank">reported by the BBC</A>.<BR>
  <BR>
  Users may be able to subscribe to   the learning platform through an RSS or similar feed. This will allow them to be   notified of updates and to receive regular materials, such as podcasts. Trainees   should be aware of the technicalities involved in creating and receiving feeds   for such services. <BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>E-portfolio</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  The DfES e-strategy   requires all pupils to have access to a digital repository. One way of providing   this is in the form of an e-portfolio. Such a space provides opportunity for the   storage, assessment and showcasing of pupil work. In some cases the e-portfolio   may also facilitate transfer between schools and other sectors as it will itself   be transferable. Trainees should discuss the ways in which ICT can help with the   transfer process through an e-portfolio. They should also discuss the drawbacks,   technical and social, in building up large folios of electronic work.<BR>
  <BR>
  A   new resource on e-portfolios and e-assessment is being developed for this   website during 2008.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Reusable learning objects   (RLOs)</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  Activities and resources can be bundled together to construct   a &lsquo;learning object&rsquo;. This is a discrete entity in the learning platform&rsquo;s   digital repository. The concept of reusability of learning objects implies the   detaching of the object from any assessments, feedback or individual user. It   usually is coupled with concepts of interoperability whereby objects can be   moved from one platform to another according to a standardised protocol, such as   SCORM.<BR>

This page discusses a number of pieces of   hardware that trainee teachers may find in the classroom.<BR>

</UL>
As with all aspects of their school placements while   training, there are opportunities for trainees to share experiences &ndash; hardware   that is common in one school may be unknown in another. They should also draw on   their pupils' experience as new hardware often finds its way into homes before   it finds its way into schools. An example of this is mature market for handheld   games machines in homes compared to the newly-emerging use of such devices in   schools. Extending this, trainees might usefully consider the policies for use   of devices brought into school. For example, is the mobile phone a tool for the   bully, a distraction to learning or a multi-media information   device?<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Interactive whiteboard (IWB)</strong><BR>
<BR>
Interactive   whiteboards provide opportunities for whole class interactive teaching and   learning. By this is meant the interactivity that is gained by having a   versatile resource that can be manipulated by any one pupil (or the teacher) and   seen by the whole class. This includes control of presentations, rearrangement   of items on screen e.g. to match and develop concepts, hyperlinking to   multimedia objects, selection and restriction of screen areas to provide for   focus.<BR>
<BR>
IWBs are being used extensively in schools and colleges. It is   essential that trainee teachers not only develop the skills and competence   required to use IWBs successfully but they also understand how to interact with   the boards and the pupils they teach. Among the various advantages of IWBs   are:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>allowing all members of the group to see resources, presentations and   demonstrations clearly;  
  <LI>enabling smoother transitions between activities within a lesson, because   diverse resources, such as word processor, video clips, web pages, images, etc,   can be readily available and easily combined;  
  <LI>enabling complex processes to be demonstrated step by step to whole groups;  
  <LI>encouraging visualisation of difficult concepts and processes;  
  <LI>reinforcing communally constructed learning through interaction between   students and the board, for example by providing a visual forum for compiling   ideas on a topic.</LI>
</UL>
The IWB itself is only part of a larger system.   Trainees will need to understand how the software to control the board works.   Most boards will inter-relate with other pieces of software, for example, to   allow slides to be annotated by hand and resaved. IWB software usually provides   additional functionality, such as reveal or magnify, and trainees should be   encouraged to explore these tools with a view to evaluating their pedagogical   impact. <BR>
<BR>
An evaluation by Hall and Higgins (2005) of <A href="external.html?link=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/jcal/2005/00000021/00000002/art00003?crawler=true" target="blank">the use of IWBs in primary schools</A> found that pupils were   enthusiastic about their use and the ways in which they enlivened learning, but   cited constraints due to access to the technology and associated technical and   pedagogical problems. Hall and Higgins also reported on the tension between the   use of the IWB and its drawing the teacher to the front of the class and the   interactivity with pupils at their tables. Somekh et al's 2007 <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/upload-dir/downloads/page_documents/research/whiteboards_expansion_summary.pdf" target="blank">SWEEP report</A> finds, however, that as there is an increase in   interactivity the impact of the loss of group work is negligible. <BR>
<BR>
The   SWEEP report also highlights the multi-sensory nature of the use of IWBs, "The   interactive whiteboard acts as a multi-modal portal, giving teachers the   potential to use still images, moving images and sound," (p5).<BR>
<BR>
Further   sources of information are <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/upload-dir/downloads/page_documents/research/wtrs_whiteboards.pdf" target="blank">Becta's review of research</A> and <A href="external.html?link=http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR816.pdf" target="blank">research from the Institute of Education</A>. The last of these   casts a critical eye on the pedagogical impact of IWBs and contrasts with the   findings of the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.evaluation.icttestbed.org.uk/learning" target="blank">final evaluation</A> of the four-year ICT Test Bed project which   claims that &ldquo;Effective use of presentation technologies led to greater   interaction between teachers and learners&rdquo; (p5).<BR>

<BR>
<strong>Portable Devices</strong><BR>
<BR>
The description   &lsquo;portable ICT device&rsquo; covers a wide range of machines with very varied   functions. This section describes the use of some of these devices. In most case   there is some form of connectivity between the device and a network or computer,   in the case of peripherals.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Connectivity</em><BR>
<BR>
Increasingly   portable devices are connected via wireless local area networks using the 802.11   or Wi-Fi protocol. This is the method for connecting computers to a wireless hub   or router and it is becoming more prevalent in other devices such as printers,   projectors and cameras. The Becta <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/upload-dir/downloads/page_documents/research/wireless_networks_in_schools_survey.doc" target="blank">survey</A> on wireless found that<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Fifty-seven per cent of primary schools and 34 per cent of secondary schools   had over 75 per cent wireless coverage of their school buildings.  
  <LI>One per cent of primary schools and 22 per cent of secondary schools allow   personally owned pupil devices onto the wireless network.   
  <LI>Twenty six per cent of primary schools and 42 per cent of secondary schools   allow personally owned teacher devices onto the wireless   network.</LI>
</UL>
Trainee teachers should be encouraged to discuss the findings   of this survey and reflect on their own circumstances in schools. The survey   found that the most popular reason for implementing wireless was to support the   use of ICT in classrooms other than ICT suites. This will have a profound effect   on the way in which ICT is perceived by teachers and pupils and on the style of   learning and teaching that can be adopted.<BR>
<BR>
There have been numerous   concerns about the safety of wireless networks, due to the increase in radio   frequency (RF) electro-magnetic radiation. Becta&rsquo;s <A href="external.html?link=http://news.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?resID=33517" target="blank">advice</A> is to follow the guidance of the Health Protection   Agency and states that "There is no consistent evidence of health effects from   RF exposures below guideline levels and therefore no reason why schools and   others should not use wi-fi equipment."<BR>
<BR>
Other methods of connectivity   include Bluetooth, which is often used in conjunction with a USB dongle to allow   for a device such as a wireless mouse to connect to a computer, and infra   red.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Laptops</em><BR>
<BR>
Schools are increasingly using laptops for   teachers and pupils. <A href="external.html?link=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/11/20263/46765" target="blank">Research in Scotland</A> by Simpson and Payne reported <BR>
<UL>
  <LI>changed approaches in classroom management and organisation  
  <LI>increased use of ICT for administrative purposes  
  <LI>taking laptops home for homework and extension of work.   
  <LI>pupils becoming focused, motivated and confident users of ICT together with   having the ability to work as independent learners</LI>
</UL>
Set against these   benefits trainees will need to consider the classroom management issues in using   laptop computers (see also <A href="text_only6f27.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=13&ts=4">Managing   the wireless classroom</A> in the Behaviour Management resource on this   website). Often these will be stored away and need to be started up at the start   of a lesson. Considerations include movement around the classroom by pupils   fetching computers, trailing mains leads and the need to ensure that the laptops   are kept charged. Trolley or rack systems are available to charge class sets of   laptops. <BR>
<BR>
A further issue is the taking up of table space by the   introduction of computers. The use of newer ultra-portable notebooks provides a   smaller &lsquo;footprint&rsquo; and also allows pupils to carry the devices around more   easily should they need to.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Tablet PCs</em><BR>
<BR>
Tablet PCs provide   additional functionality to that of a traditional laptop and this opens up new   possibilities for using them with trainee teachers and pupils. The screen of the   computer twists flat and can be used as a touch sensitive writing tablet. This   allows for non-keyed entry, which provides for more flexibility.<BR>
<BR>
Wireless   tablet PCs or laptops can be used in conjunction with wireless projectors to   allow pupil screens to be displayed at the front of the class. This provides   opportunities for teachers to work at a table with the pupils while   demonstrating to the whole class. In doing so, similar pedagogical benefits to   an IWB are reported but with the additional advantage of not placing the teacher   at the front of the class. This gives the pupils more ownership of their   learning.<BR>
<BR>
Case studies of their use can be used with trainees. Two such   studies are of <A href="external.html?link=http://www.djanogly.notts.sch.uk/C8/Publications/Document%20Library/DCA%20-%20New%20Technologies%20iNET%20Paper2.pdf" target="blank">Djanogly City Academy</A> and <A href="external.html?link=http://www.rm.com/Secondary/CaseStudies/CaseStudyDetail.asp?cref=CS113293" target="blank">Cornwallis School</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Handheld devices</em><BR>
<BR>
While   laptops and tablets are fully functioning PCs, there is also increasing use of   smaller, cheaper devices such as palmtops and PDAs. These have the advantage of   easier storage and mobility. Trainees should explore how such devices are being   used in their placement schools and colleges. They should be made aware of the   potential opportunities when learning takes place out of traditional classroom   settings. These include on the sports field, on field trips and in settings such   as museums. Examples of use can be found in <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/upload-dir/downloads/page_documents/research/handhelds.pdf" target="blank">Perry&rsquo;s report</A> for Becta and in the case study of <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/upload-dir/downloads/page_documents/research/warren_comprehensive_school.doc" target="blank">Warren School&rsquo;s collaboration</A> with a local museum. PDAs are   also being used increasingly with e-books &ndash; both those obtained from publishers   and those created by pupils.<BR>
<BR>
Mobile phones are increasingly becoming   multi-functional and can carry out many of the tasks that a PDA can. They have   the added advantage of being very readily available to pupils. Nevertheless, as   referred to earlier, their use in schools is increasingly controversial - see,   for example this <A href="external.html?link=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6215532.stm" target="blank">BBC report</A>, a <A href="external.html?link=http://teaching.mrbelshaw.co.uk/index.php/2006/09/21/20-ideas-getting-students-to-use-their-mobile-phones-as-learning-tools/" target="blank">blog post</A> by a teacher and Becta's <A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=is&catcode=ss_to_es_pp_mob_03" target="blank">advice</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Other handheld devices include calculators and   data logging devices, which have specialist application in mathematics and   science. Trainees should explore how the use of these can contribute to the   National Curriculum in those subjects and in ICT.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Games   consoles</em><BR>
<BR>
Pupils increasingly have access to games consoles at home.   Some schools are now making use of these devices to complement their more   traditional ICT hardware. As <A href="external.html?link=http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2187034/school-trades-textbooks-psps" target="blank">reported</A> in <em>Computing</em>, such devices can increasingly act   as PDAs as well as games consoles and have the advantage of high quality video   processors.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Voting systems</em><BR>
<BR>
Class sets of voting systems   allow pupils to respond to questions and for charts of their responses to be   displayed. Typically there will be one transceiver plugged into a USB port, one   teacher&rsquo;s keypad and a number of pupil keypads. Some systems allow for free text   entry as well as numeric responses.<BR>
<BR>
A Becta <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh&catcode=_re_mr_cs_wc_04&rid=14107" target="blank">case study</A> into their use at two schools found that voting   sytems<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>enable teachers to quickly check pupils' understanding   
  <LI>enable teachers to gauge pupils&rsquo; opinions   
  <LI>enable all pupils to actively participate in lessons   
  <LI>reduce the amount of marking needed   
  <LI>provide for easy tracking of pupils' progress</LI>
</UL>
<p><strong>Other   devices</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  Trainees should be encouraged to share their experiences of   other devices used in classrooms. These may include wireless keyboards and mice,   clickers and pointers, which allow pupils and teachers to interact with displays   without coming to the front of the class.<BR>
  <BR>
  They also include still and   moving digital video cameras and audio recording equipment and headphones. The   use of &lsquo;green&rsquo; or &lsquo;blue&rsquo; screens for overlaying videos is becoming more   prevalent.<BR>
  <BR>
  Visualisers are being found in a range of settings and 3D   printers are being introduced into design and technology lessons.<BR>
  <BR>
  MP3 and   MP4 players are being used by pupils for music and video, but they can also be   used to download educational content or subscribe to podcasts. <BR>
  <BR>
  Finally,   there is a range of devices associated with identity management such as   fingerprint scanners, swipe cards and cashless canteen systems. Trainees should   be encouraged to discuss the social implications of these.<BR>

<H1>Multimedia</H1>
<BR>
Multimedia includes the use, and combination of, text,   audio, still images, animation, video, and interactive content, such as   hyperlinks. The use of ICT tools allows trainees, pupils and tutors to create   resources and products in a range of media. Such activities provide especially   well for addressing creativity. They also allow for support of multi-sensory   learning and trainees should be encouraged to explore their use in the context   of meeting special needs and differentiation. These help address the   requirements of standards Q19, Q25a and Q25d in particular. In addition, with   all of the tools there are opportunities for developing group and team work and   for problem solving.<BR>
<BR>
A number of tools are considered on this page<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Digital Video  
  <LI>Multimedia books  
  <LI>Video conferencing  
  <LI>Podcasts  
  <LI>Animation</LI>
</UL>
For each of the tools covered on this page, trainees   could review the benefits and approaches reported and reflect on how they might   include the use of the tools in their school settings. Tutors could provide   activities to develop the use of the tools and the understanding of their   particular affordances and the influence they have on   pedagogy.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Digital Video</strong><BR>
<BR>
Digital video provides a medium   whereby pupils, and teachers, can create audio and video productions and then   manipulate them using ICT. <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/page_documents/research/dvreport_241002.pdf" target="blank">Research</A> summarised by Becta listed advantages for pupils and   teachers. These included increased motivation, literacy skills, collaboration,   creativity and self-expression and community-based learning.<BR>
<BR>
The use of   green or blue screen technology allows for videos to be mixed with other digital   presentations. An example of their use is provided by <A href="external.html?link=http://www.coseley.dudley.gov.uk/dance/bluescreen.htm" target="blank">Coseley School</A>.<BR>

<p>Loveless,   Burton and Turvey (2006) report in <A href="external.html?link=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B7XN8-4JDT11X-3&_user=10&_coverDate=04%2F30%2F2006&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=548654141aaf493615d729fa7320367d" target="blank">Thinking Skills and Creativity</A> on a project in which trainee   teachers investigate their classroom practice in the use of ICT to promote   creativity through the making of digital video movies, and to reflect upon the   development of their pedagogy with ICT in primary   classrooms.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Multimedia books</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  Multimedia, or talking, books   may be created by or for pupils. These combine traditional text and images in   slide show format with audio, and less commonly video. Examples of their use are   in supporting young readers, pupils with English as an additional language (EAL)   or with particular special educational needs. <BR>
  <BR>
  The Portsmouth EMAS   service provide a website of <A href="external.html?link=http://www.blss.portsmouth.sch.uk/resources/talkbks.shtml" target="blank">case studies</A> of the production of such &lsquo;books&rsquo; int he context   of English as an dddiitonal language.<BR>
  <BR>
  The National Strategy 's <A href="external.html?link=http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/primaryframework/literacy/ictapplications/" target="blank">primary framework for literacy</A> lists a range of use for ICT in   supporting literacy activities. These include the creation of multimedia books.   Examples of activites listed include KS2 pupils producing talking picture books   intended for children in a reception class and the creation of multimedia   presentations of pupils&rsquo; or other writers&rsquo; poems.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Video   conferencing</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  Using video conferencing (VC) allows trainee teachers to   be placed in an environment where they can support or be supported remotely. VC   enables trainees and tutors in different locations to talk to and see each   other. VC sessions may also allow digital files to be exchanged or shared and   enables trainees, or trainees and tutors, to work together remotely on a single   file. The Open University have developed a <A href="external.html?link=http://flashmeeting.open.ac.uk/" target="blank">Flash-based system</A> for VC so that the costs are very low &ndash;   participants requiring only a simple webcam.<BR>
  <BR>
  As <A href="external.html?link=http://education.guardian.co.uk/elearning/story/0,,1801081,00.html" target="blank">reported</A> in <em>The Guardian</em>, Nottingham University and the   TDA have researched the use of VC for observing trainees on placement. This   extends the more common use of video for assessment of teaching either by the   trainees themselves, their peers or their tutors. <BR>
  <BR>
  The <A href="external.html?link=http://www.global-leap.com/" target="blank">Global Leap   website</A> provides further examples of the use of VC in   education.<BR>
  <BR>
  Video conferencing also provides opportunities for pupils to   learn with others remote from the classroom. These may include pupils in other   schools, or teachers or other experts in other locations. Trainees could   experiment with teaching remotely using this technology, maybe to their peers in   the first instance. Such use of remote experts can also be supported by other   technologies, such as a discussion forum. <BR>
  <BR>
  <A href="external.html?link=http://www.wmnet.org.uk/vc/" target="blank">Practical   guides</A> that focus of the technical and pedagogical issues of using VC are   available from a Becta-funded project carried out by   WMnet.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Podcasts</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  A podcast is an audio or video file that is   uploaded to a server and that can be subscribed to using suitable software. It   can then be transferred to an MP3 or MP4 player (the latter supporting video).   Schools can make use of this for providing short pieces of &lsquo;content&rsquo;. Further,   pupils can be engaged in the creation of their own podcasts. <BR>

  Technical   issues in the use of podcasts by training providers, or in schools, are   associated with the need to upload the files and then subscribe to them. This   may involve ftp access to, and RSS feed from, a server. Trainees should   understand these technical issues. A partial solution is to share audio files   without automatic subscription and trainees should be able to explain the   differences between the two methods.<BR>
  <BR>
  A <A href="external.html?link=http://www.podiumpodcasting.com/pdfs/casestudy1.pdf" target="blank">case study</A> of the collaborative use of podcasts is available   from Oakington and St Mary Magdalene Schools. A larger project of a school radio   station, incorporating podcasts, is available from <A href="external.html?link=http://www.downsfm.com/" target="blank">The Downs   School</A>.<BR>

  <strong>Animation</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  Animations may be created in two   dimensions, using Flash or other graphics software, or in three dimensions using   cameras and &lsquo;stop-frame&rsquo; software. The <A href="external.html?link=http://www.digitalcreativity.org/category/activity/animation/" target="blank">Digital Creativity</A> website has a series of case studies of its   use with pupils and teachers.<BR>
  <BR>
  The <A href="external.html?link=http://www.filmeducation.org/primary/animation/stopmotion.html" target="blank">FIlm Education website</A> gives some guidance on the use of   animations with pupils. They stress that 'Animation' is a performing art rather   than a graphic art and has much in common with drama. This highlights the need   for team work. <BR>

<H1>Software for collaboration</H1>
<BR>
ICT provides opportunities of   collaboration in the creation and sharing of resources and also the joint   construction of knowledge and understanding through communication tools. This   page discusses a range of these tools<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Blogs  
  <LI>Wikis  
  <LI>Discussion forums  
  <LI>Social networking   
  <LI>Web-based applications</LI>
</UL>
<A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/upload-dir/downloads/page_documents/research/wtrs_initteachtrain.pdf" target="blank">Research evidence</A> about the impact of ICT in ITT includes the   following key benefits<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>improved communication between staff and students   
  <LI>enhanced peer support   
  <LI>extended links between campus and classroom.  
  <LI>use of ICT to provide communication links between students on teaching   practice</LI>
</UL>
This page discusses the use of collaboration and communication   tools that trainees may find their pupils using or that they may wish to   introduce into their classrooms.<BR>
<BR>
Trainees should be made aware of the   issues surrounding the use of these tools. These include<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Access issues - do the school, local authority or RBC networks allow access?  
  <LI>Can filters and ports be reconfigured to allow access, or does this   contravene current policies?  
  <LI>What are the acceptable use conditions and is there a policy in place?  
  <LI>What are the professional ethical issues involved in trainee-trainee   interaction - for example in making coments about placement schools, mentors and   tutors?  
  <LI>What are the ethical issues involved in contact with pupils via these tools?  
  <LI>What are the e-safety implications of pupils posting online?</LI>
</UL>
A <A href="external.html?link=http://www.childnet.com/kia/" target="blank">set of   resources</A> have been produced by Childnet, with input from ITTE, on e-safety.   These include guidelines for trainee   teachers.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Blogs</strong><BR>
<BR>
Originally conceived of as a personal   online diary the weblog allows the owner to post items that are stamped by the   time of their creation and with keywords chosen by the author. In this sense it   is a tool to aid self-reflection or evaluation<BR>
<BR>
Items or posts are   usually, but always, quite short and may be linked to other items through   hyperlinks, keywords or shared taxonomies or bookmarks such as <A href="external.html?link=http://www.digg.com/" target="blank">Digg</A>, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.reddit.com/" target="blank">Reddit</A> or <A href="external.html?link=http://del.icio.us/" target="blank">Delicious</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Each item in the blog can usually be   commented upon and this opens up the possibility of discussion around a topic.   This is one way in which collaboration can take place. One pupil posts and the   others comment. Another way is to have multiple owners/authors of a blog. <BR>
<BR>
Blogs are implicitly public as they are posted on the web. Teachers, and   pupils, can usually restrict access through a range of means &ndash; hiding the blog   from search engines, named access only, passwords, etc. Trainees should consider   a range of blogging environments and evaluate them for privacy and safety. Becta   provide a set of <A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=is&catcode=ss_to_es_tl_uor_03&rid=11086" target="blank">guidelines</A> on their safe and acceptable use.<BR>
<BR>
Files may   be attached to blog posts and so they provide a simple example of a personal   e-portfolio. <BR>
<BR>
A <A href="external.html?link=http://www.teachers.tv/video/167" target="blank">case   study</A> of their use is provided by O&rsquo;Hear on Teachers   TV.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Wikis</strong><BR>
<BR>
A wiki is a collaboratively created and edited   website consisting of a set of pages. Trainees, and pupils, will be familiar   with Wikipedia but may not have used it for editing and creation of new items.   Similarly they may not have created their own wiki from scratch. One particular   use with trainees is the co-creation of resources and plans for team teaching or   for sharing resources across distance when on placement. In this sense they form   a collaborative e-portfolio.<BR>
<BR>
There are similar privacy and safety   considerations with wikis as with blogs. Additionally the ability to edit any   one else&rsquo;s work requires quite clear codes of conduct to be   negotiated.<BR>
<BR>
In seeing that anyone can edit anything, trainees should also   be able to discuss the reliability of Wikipedia and other such   resources.<BR>
<BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://www.futurelab.org.uk/resources/publications_reports_articles/discussion_papers/Discussion_Paper258/" target="blank">Research</A> into the use of wikis has been carried out by Grant   for Futurelab. This highlights, in particular the collaboration and joint   construction of new content by pupils.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Discussion   forums</strong><BR>
<BR>
While blogs, and wikis, allow for comments to be posted onto   items they are not intrinsically designed for discussions. Trainees should   consider the features available in the tools that they use and make informed   choices as their use. They should also review the tools available on the VLE in   their schools and providers. <BR>
<BR>
Boulton and Bradshaw provide a case study   of the use of a range of communication tools with PGCE trainee   teachers.<BR>

<BR>
<strong>Social networking </strong><BR>
<BR>
Trainees may use   sites such as <A href="external.html?link=http://www.myspace.com/" target="blank">MySpace</A>, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.bebo.com/" target="blank">Bebo</A> and <A href="external.html?link=http://www.facebook.com/" target="blank">Facebook</A> for their own social interactions. Their pupils will   almost certainly do the same. There has also been some use of such spaces to   support learning.<BR>
<BR>
These sites provide ample opportunity to discuss issues   of e-safety - see <A href="external.html?link=http://www.childnet.com/kia/" target="blank">Childnet resources</A> and the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/" target="blank">CEOP</A> website. Further they are examples of large data sets of users with associated   attributes. This may provide a fruitful context for the study of data in the new   ICT National Curriculum. <BR>
<BR>
Futurelab identify two converging trends in   their <A href="external.html?link=http://www.futurelab.org.uk/resources/publications_reports_articles/opening_education_reports/" target="blank">&lsquo;Opening Education&rsquo; report</A>. They identify a change in the   educational arena as to the purpose of education and the role of teachers and   learners. This, they say, is matched by the change in the development of   technologies that allows for learning and collaborating together.<BR>
<BR>
When   considering social networking sites, trainees should be made aware of the issues   that arise through extended networks, as identified in this <A href="external.html?link=http://www.tes.co.uk/search/story/?story_id=2605871" target="blank">TES article</A>, where teachers were putting unsuitable material   into their online space.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Web-based applications</strong><BR>
<BR>
Further   collaboration opportunities are provided by web-based word processors,   spreadsheets etc. <BR>
<BR>
Futurelab's <A href="external.html?link=http://www.futurelab.org.uk/projects/why_dont_you/" target="blank">Why Don't You...</A> project is largely concerned with how such   tools might be influencing education. Little research has yet (2008) been done   on the use of such tools. Trainees should be encouraged to explore their use and   how they might provide opportunities for collaboration, learning beyond the   classroom and portability of electronic artefacts.<BR>
<BR>
They should also be   made aware of the copyright and intellectual property right issues with storing   work online. Usually the ownership resides with the provider of the tool, not of   the author.<BR>
