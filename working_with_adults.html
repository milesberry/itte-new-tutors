<H2>Working with Adults</H2>
<p><br>
  As part of the <a href="external.html?link=http://www.remodelling.org/" target="blank">workforce reform agenda</a> (remodelling) there is an increasing emphasis on support for teachers both inside and outside the classroom.

<H1>ICT Technical Support Staff</H1>
<BR>
ICT teachers work closely with ICT   technical staff and familiarity with their roles as well as the ICT   infrastructure of the school are important. However, arrangements in individual   schools differ so trainees will need to check what applies in the schools in   which they work. Technical staff roles range from those offering basic   maintenance to managing complex hardware installations and making a significant   contribution to the school&rsquo;s ICT strategy. While some support staff will have   little in the way of formal technical qualifications, others may be keen to   extend their professional development through, for example, a work-based degree   for ICT (see for example <A href="external.html?link=http://degree.ultralab.net/" target="blank">http://degree.ultralab.net</A>).<BR>
<BR>
Trainees should invest time   in finding out about the technical support staff they work with, their roles and   their range of expertise. It can be useful to make a requirement of trainees to   interview a member of the technical support team near to the start of each   placement. <BR>
<BR>
ICT technical staff may use the resources available on the   Becta website. Of particular use is the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.becta.org.uk/fits" target="blank">Framework   for ICT Technical Support (FITS)</A> and <A href="external.html?link=http://www.becta.org.uk/fits_om/" target="blank">FITS   OM</A>; the latter provides an overarching management strategy for technical   support in schools. Note - the Building Schools for the Future programme (BSF)   makes it a requirement that schools have strategies in place for providing   technical support. See <A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=lv&catcode=ss_lv_bud_fun_03&rid=14606" target="blank">Becta FITS BSF</A> and <A href="external.html?link=http://www.partnershipsforschools.org.uk/library/the_role_of_ict.jsp" target="blank">Partnership for Schools</A>.<BR>
<BR>
This BECTA service is a highly   practical toolkit of advice, checklists and tools to help schools implement best   practice ICT infrastructure management and technical support. It defines ten   processes that technical support should carry out to manage a stable, reliable   and available ICT infrastructure and provide the school&rsquo;s ICT user with the   service they need to carry out their day to day teaching and learning. Trainees   may find this helps them to identify questions to ask about infrastructure and   support in their placement schools, and later in the school where they take up   their first teaching post. It will also be a valuable resource to support them   later in their career when they take on ICT managerial tasks.<BR>
<BR>
The Becta   website also contains advice on <A href="external.html?link=http://www.schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=tl&rid=151" target="blank">Health and Safety</A>, both in setting up an ICT installation and   in ensuring its safe use.<BR>

<H1>Classroom Assistants</H1>
<BR>
As the use of classroom assistants in schools   in increases, there is a likelihood that within an ICT classroom the trainee   teacher could be offered an assistant to work under his or her direction with   one or more teaching groups. In these circumstances, the trainee needs to   consider how to use this help to best support teaching and learning in the   classroom. In order to do this the trainee will have to
<UL>
  <LI>Find out about the expected role of the teaching assistant   
  <LI>Involve the teaching assistant in planning lessons  
  <LI>Discuss in detail the teaching assistant&rsquo;s role within each lesson  
  <LI>Give explicit guidance on expected pupil outcomes  
  <LI>Monitor the work of the teaching assistant during the lesson  
  <LI>Obtain feedback from the teaching assistant about pupils&rsquo; achievements and   areas of work that were too easy or too difficult.</LI>
</UL>
Research suggests   that using classroom assistants in professional roles rather than the delegation   of menial tasks leads to greater success in the classroom. This success is based   on the quality of the relationship between the teacher and the assistant,   working as a supportive team, as well as the assistant and the pupils. <BR>
<BR>
Trainees should find out what the school&rsquo;s policies are relating to the   roles and responsibilities of support staff. Since this is an emerging   development, particularly as a result of workforce reform, in many schools this   information may not be readily available. <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
The   GMB Union, representing classroom assistants, has guidelines for schools to   follow. Among their recommendations are:
<UL>
  <LI>Defined roles and responsibilities disseminated to staff and pupils  
  <LI>A consistent and coherent set of job titles  
  <LI>A whole school approach to information, consultation and involvement, which   would include attendance at staff meetings and preparation time within   contracted hours  
  <LI>Appropriate training and development provision</LI>
</UL>
As the role of   classroom assistant is developing, the responsibilities and expectations are   likely to differ from school to school, and trainees will need to seek the   advice of the Head of Department or ICT Co-ordinator. Nevertheless the following   points may be helpful.<BR>
<BR>
Within the classroom the ICT teacher should   consider the following opportunities provided by extra assistance within the   classroom. These opportunities will, inevitably depend upon the personal   qualities of the assistant, their skills, personality, and the rapport they have   with children.
<UL>
  <LI>Providing general whole class support, including guidance on written tasks,   such as layout, spelling and additional explanations to small groups or   individuals to ensure tasks are completed.  
  <LI>Organising small groups to improve specific ICT skills, resolve common ICT   problems, or provide greater challenge.  
  <LI>Preparation and delivery of individual education plans with individual   pupils within the classroom.</LI>
</UL>
The teacher should ensure that an   assistant is able to contribute effectively by involving the assistant in   planning the lesson and briefing the assistant clearly about what he/she should   or should not do and about the expected pupil outcomes. <BR>
<BR>
Ofsted evaluated   the role of <A href="external.html?link=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Publications-and-research/Browse-all-by/Education/Leadership/Management/Teaching-assistants-in-primary-schools-an-evaluation-of-the-quality-and-impact-of-their-work/(language)/eng-GB" target="blank">teaching assistants in primary schools</A>. Several of the key   points Ofsted made are also relevant to secondary teachers. Amongst these are:
<UL>
  <LI>As the role of teaching assistants shifts towards providing learning support   they have less time for managing and preparing resources &ndash; the balance between   these roles needs to be well managed if teachers are to reap the full benefits   of teaching assistant support   
  <LI>The quality of teaching improves when teaching assistants work in close   partnership with teachers or follow tightly prescribed programmes  
  <LI>Teaching assistants can only be effective if they have the necessary   knowledge and skills to work effectively with pupils [training, joint planning,   detailed briefings and feedback are important in this respect]  
  <LI>Teachers should be alert to the amount of time individual pupils or groups   of pupils, eg those with special educational needs, spend with teaching   assistants rather than being taught by a qualified teacher. </LI>
</UL>

<H1>Working with Adult Learners</H1>
<BR>
Once appointed, ICT teachers may be   encouraged to teach adults as part of a school&rsquo;s community education programme.   ICT courses for adults are very popular and can be a form of relaxation after   the rigours of teaching children all day! Trainees and newly appointed teachers   of ICT may also be encouraged to deliver part of the ICT development programme   targeted at the rest of the school staff. This can be a daunting prospect and   should only undertaken if the trainee or teacher is both competent and   confident. It can be a boost to their standing within the   school.<BR>
<BR>
Although newly qualified teachers (NQTs) will have some   experience of teaching children from teaching practices, the prospect of   teaching adults may be a new experience.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>What are the similarities and   differences between children and adults as learners?</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Adults' participation in learning is voluntary.  
  <LI>Adults' reasons for participation are many and varied. They have a variety   of needs and demands for education at different points in their lives, depending   on their previous education, the roles they currently perform and the goals they   wish to achieve.   
  <LI>Both children and adults may have had negative experiences of education   whilst at school.  
  <LI>Within a class of children or adults there may be a broad range of ICT   skills depending on prior experience. </LI>
</UL>
<strong>Should adults be taught   differently to children?</strong><BR>
The debate regarding teaching methods is   discussed elsewhere on this website in relation to teaching trainee teachers (<A href="text_onlyf46c.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=1&ts=1">Teaching   Approaches and the Role of the Tutor</A>). The pedagogy relating to adults as   lifelong learners is also the subject of much discussion. Given the broad range   of learners and their previous experience there are questions as to whether any   one type of pedagogy is effective with all adult learners. Just as in the   classroom, you might expect to find a wide range of preferred learning styles   within any adult group.<BR>
<BR>
Hodgson and Kambouri (1999) argue that there are   three major factors which underpin the way in which adults learn. These factors   - personal characteristics, reasons for participation and the context in which   the learning takes place, have a determining effect on the type of pedagogy that   will be perceived as practical, useful or relevant to different groups of   learners.<BR>
<BR>
Exploring different styles of teaching is perhaps the best way   to approach the teaching of adults. There may be opportunities to try out new   ideas before attempting them with children. It can be an enjoyable, rewarding   experience which will be very different from teaching children. And they might   be better behaved!!<BR>
<BR>
<strong>What to teach? </strong><BR>
There are a wide range of   ICT courses to cover all ranges of ability from absolute beginners&rsquo; classes to   highly advanced courses in specific ICT applications. More experienced staff in   school would be able to advise but it is worth also finding out which courses   are currently on offer in the area, e.g. at other schools, the local further   education college, LearnDirect. Many schools work in partnership with other   course providers. This is an option worth exploring, not just to extend the   range of courses offered, but to link into their expertise and the broader range   of services and facilities they may offer.<BR>
<BR>
<A href="text_only651f.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=5&tp=2&ts=1">Examination   Boards</A> provide details of the courses and qualifications   available.<BR>
<BR>
See related section for a detailed account of vocational   qualifications.<BR>
