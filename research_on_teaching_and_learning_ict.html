<H2>Research on Teaching and Learning ICT - Overview</H2>
<br>This part of the site looks at examples of research into teaching and learning ICT. It will give you an overview to some of the questions researchers have raised and point you towards relevant resources. It is divided into 6 pages in which questions are raised and selected papers referenced. The first three pages cover more general topics:<blockquote>• <a href="text_onlyca4c.html?url=/index.php&amp;layout=1&amp;sec=6&amp;tp=1&amp;ts=2">ICT the subject </a>. <br>•  <a href="text_onlyef50.html?url=/index.php&amp;layout=1&amp;sec=6&amp;tp=1&amp;ts=3">ICT and pedagogy</a> <br>•  <a href="text_only5c6a.html?url=/index.php&amp;layout=1&amp;sec=6&amp;tp=1&amp;ts=4">ICT across the curriculum</a></blockquote> 
<p><br>
  <br>The second set of pages look at three more specific topics:<blockquote>•  <a href="text_only12e9.html?url=/index.php&amp;layout=1&amp;sec=6&amp;tp=1&amp;ts=5">ICT and modelling</a> <br>•  <a href="text_onlyf746.html?url=/index.php&amp;layout=1&amp;sec=6&amp;tp=1&amp;ts=6">ICT and communicating for audience and purpose</a> <br>•  <a href="text_onlye306.html?url=/index.php&amp;layout=1&amp;sec=6&amp;tp=1&amp;ts=7">ICT and information handling</a><br>author: Michael Hammond<br>

<H1>ICT: the subject</H1>
<BR>
<strong>ICT is a new subject</strong> and ICT has only been   offered as a PGCE specialism since 1997. As is well known, IT capability was   presented as a strand of &lsquo;Technology&rsquo; when the first national curriculum   documents appeared in England and Wales (Department of Education and Science   1990). IT became a subject in its own right in 1995 (Department for Education   1995) and the training of specialist IT teachers began in 1997. The National   Curriculum was further revised in 1999 when IT was renamed Information and   Communication Technology (ICT) and revised again in 2008 though in a small scale   way. Programmes of study in England are now grouped around the five key   concepts: capability; communication and collaboration; exploring ideas and   manipulating information; impact of technology; and critical evaluation.   However, the key processes probably have greater recognition in school, these   are: finding information; developing ideas; communicating information;   evaluating.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>The nature and scope of ICT is unusual in the school   curriculum</strong> as it has a specific focus on progression through capability   (Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy has often been seen as an implicit point of reference in   showing progression through attainment targets, Bloom 1956). A second   peculiarity is that ICT subject matter cuts across arts, science and humanity   faculties. Indeed ICT has been seen as appealing to a wide range of multiple   intelligences (Gardner 2000). A third feature of our subject is widespread use   of ICT outside the classroom (Sanger 1997; Sutherland et al 2000; Somekh et al   2002b) and the issues this raises for addressing progression in ICT and adapting   the curriculum to pupil interests.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>The push for ICT to be made a   separate subject </strong>came in part from OFSTED concerns that progression in   pupils&rsquo; ICT capability was haphazard in schools which adopted a solely cross   curricular approach (OFSTED 1999. 2001b). This gave rise to curriculum models   which mixed ICT as a subject with cross curricular provision (eg Crawford 1997,   NCET 1995, Selwood and Jenkinson 1995). In practice there were continuing   concerns over the coverage of all strands of the ICT curriculum (control being a   prime example) and the de facto identification of ICT lessons as focused on   computer skills so that, in many schools, pupils set to work through MS Office   tutorials in ICT lessons. The key stage 3 strategy sought to raise the profile   of ICT as a subject through a clear recommendation that it should be timetabled   for a minimum of one hour a week and a definition of ICT in terms of &lsquo;ICT   capability&rsquo;. The impact of the strategy is still to be assessed and the adoption   of ICT across the curriculum remains a concern.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>The nature and role of   ICT as a subject is often misunderstood</strong> and viewed critically by some   commentators. The &lsquo;balkanisation&rsquo; of the curriculum into subject specialisms has   been critiqued in general terms by writers such as Ivor Goodson (1993). There is   clearly a debate to be had here, but no reasons to single ICT out &ndash; one can as   easily ask whether mathematics, English, science etc. should be separate   subjects. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>Some focus questions</strong> you might want to ask about ICT as   a subject are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>&bull; <em>What should the ICT curriculum cover?</em><BR>
  Is this adequately   covered in the framework for teaching ICT? What about models such as Kennewell&rsquo;s   (2003). Should we review the rationale (Webb 2003)? Has computing been left out   of the subject and in practice is ICT just an introduction to Microsoft Office   in most schools? Why do we spend so much time on Access and data management and   so little on social networking?<BR>
  <BR>
  &bull; <em>What does teaching ICT feel   like?</em><BR>
  A paper by Hammond looks at different perspectives on teaching ICT   (Hammond and Mumtaz 2001). Is the distinction between a focus on skills and   focus on products a useful one?<BR>
  <BR>
  &bull; <em>Who are we attracting to teach ICT   and how do their careers progress?</em><BR>
  Papers by Hammond (2002a, 2002b and   2004) report on entrants in one institution, on experiences of new ICT teachers   in school and on teachers of ICT. A paper by Australian researchers looks at   girls&rsquo; attitudes to studying ICT (Anderson et al   2008).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1>ICT and pedagogy </H1>
<BR>
Alexander (1992) identified teaching methods and   pupil organisation as the two facets of pedagogy and implied that a pedagogy of   ICT should be viewed within a broad framework of educational practice. According   to Shulman (1987) when teachers are planning lessons and deciding how to   intervene during lessons they employ pedagogical reasoning that uses a range of   types of knowledge. There is evidence that key pedagogic decisions are   influenced strongly by teachers&rsquo; ideas, beliefs and values (Fang 1996),   (Moseley, Higgins et al. 1999), many of which are taken for granted, and   unexplored in any great depth. <BR>
<BR>
Pedagogical concepts are interpreted in a   subject-specific manner (Bromme 1995) and these subject-specific elements are   mainly encapsulated as pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) (Shulman 1987). Other   researchers have defined PCK for particular subjects, for example Linn and Hsi   (2000) state that "pedagogical content knowledge refers to knowledge about a   topic that enables improved teaching of that discipline. In science such   knowledge involves an understanding of the ideas students bring to class, the   context in which students apply their science knowledge, and the multiple models   of the same topic used by students and experts in the various contexts of   application. "(p. 37).<BR>
<BR>
Less research has focused on pedagogical reasoning   and PCK for ICT as a subject than for other subjects but some issues have been   identified (Webb, 2002) and the pedagogy associated with ICT coursework has been   explored (Webb, 2003).<BR>
<BR>
Koehler and Mishra (2005) have examined knowledge   required in technology rich learning environments and identified technological   pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) as an intersection between pedagogical   knowledge, content knowledge and technological knowledge. Research evidence   relating to pedagogy for the effective use of ICT across all subjects has been   reviewed (Cox and Webb, 2004). If learners are to be empowered to take full   advantage of the new learning opportunities provided by new technologies the   extent to which they are able to regulate their own leaning needs to be   incorporated into pedagogy. Models of self-regulated learning based on   information processing theory have been developed and applied in a number of   studies (see Greene and Azvedo 2007). However little research has been done on   how children develop as self-regulated learners (Greene and Azvedo 2007;   Dignath, Buettner et al. 2008). Involvement of learners in formative assessment   holds some promise for development of self regulation (Black and Wiliam 2006). <BR>
<BR>
<strong>Models and Frameworks for researching pedagogy </strong><BR>
<BR>
An   analysis of models that have been developed for or applied to research into   pedagogy for the use of Information Technology (IT) over the last 20 years was   undertaken by Webb (Webb 2009 in press). These include models and frameworks   developed to explore pedagogy in general (e.g. Shulman 1987; Alexander 1992;   Engestr&ouml;m 1999; Webb 2002) that have been applied to pedagogy with technology   (Webb 2002) as well as models developed specifically to understand and   characterise the role of technology in pedagogy (e.g. Squires and McDougall   1994; Laurillard, Stratfold et al. 2000; Twining 2000; Koehler and Mishra 2005).   This analysis (Webb 2009 in press) identified the following important   interrelated phenomena that have been and still are being researched using this   range of models: <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&bull; Teachers&rsquo; pedagogy and pedagogical practices when using IT <BR>
  &bull;   The affordances that various types of IT may provide for learning and   teaching<BR>
  &bull; The potential for developing pedagogy with IT <BR>
  &bull; Current and   future roles for teachers, students and the technology<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<strong>Key   questions</strong> you might want to consider in exploring pedagogy in teaching ICT   are:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&bull; How do ICT teachers draw on pedagogical principles in planning   their teaching?<BR>
  &bull; What knowledge, ideas and beliefs do ICT teachers use in   their pedagogical reasoning?<BR>
  &bull; How do the ICT resources that are available to   teachers affect their pedagogical practices and pedagogical reasoning?<BR>
  &bull; What   pedagogical content knowledge (PCK ) do ICT teachers use?<BR>
  &bull; What problems and   misconceptions do pupils encounter when learning ICT and how does teachers&rsquo;   pedagogical practice take account of these?<BR>
  &bull; How are ICT teachers&rsquo;   pedagogical practices changing as pupils&rsquo; ICT capability   changes?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<strong>Researching the pedagogy of ICT</strong><BR>
If you are   interested in researching this area there are many ways that you might start   your reading and thinking in this field. One way is outlined here.
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Read the review of pedagogy for the effective use of ICT (Cox and   Webb 2004). This provides a good overview and includes a section on ICT the   subject. It also has a large bibliography with articles that you may want to   explore.<BR>
  <BR>
  2. Read my analysis of the pedagogical reasoning process as it   applies to ICT teachers who are implementing the ICT curriculum in England (Webb   2002). Reflect on my proposed agenda for developing a pedagogy for ICT and think   about what your agenda might be.<BR>
  <BR>
  3. Read the article by Black and   Harrison (2001). This is not about ICT at all. However it is about pedagogy and   specifically it describes some outcomes from a project in which researchers   worked with teachers to develop and research their pedagogy. The report is based   on teachers&rsquo; reflective accounts of their changing practice. You may want to   consider developing and researching the pedagogy for ICT in a similar way. When   researching in the field of teaching and learning ICT we often find that   approaches and theories developed in other areas inform our work.<BR>
  <BR>
  4. Read   the article by Laurillard (2000). This focuses on pedagogical aspects of   software design and the research focuses on analysing the interactions between   the learners and the software. This paper is not about learning ICT, the   subject. However some ICT teachers are beginning to design and use software that   supports learners in learning ICT and are likely to encounter similar issues.   What are the design issues in relation to pedagogy? What is the role of the   teacher and the role of the software?<BR>
  <BR>
  5. Read the article by Pedretti et   al. (1998) about students' perspectives on teaching and learning in a   technology-enhanced secondary science classroom. This study was based primarily   interviews with student&rsquo;s.<BR>
  <BR>
  6. The articles mentioned above include a   range of different approaches to investigating pedagogy. After you have read   these articles you may have identified one or more questions that interest you.   The questions above are those that have come up in my own discussions with   teachers and other researchers but there may be many other questions associated   with the pedagogy of ICT that should be investigated. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1>ICT Across the Curriculum</H1>
<BR>
Historically, the classroom use of   computers has experienced tension between teaching &ldquo;about&rdquo; computers and   teaching &ldquo;with&rdquo; computers. The earliest examples of computer assisted learning   (CAL) were developed by enthusiastic teachers with a computer interest and   knowledge and focussed on rote skills training, closed questioning and   programming (BASIC). The justification included the value of motivation,   immediate feedback (behaviourism) and cognitive development (constructivism),   for example, LOGO (Papert, 1980; Abelson, 1982). These early experiences have   been captured in the Voices Project (Hammond et al, 2009). The next phase saw   the introduction of generic software: word processing, spreadsheets, painting   programs and database management systems such as Grass and Grasshopper from   Newman College and EdWord. The emphasis lay on using computers to support other   activities through curriculum specific and focussed tasks. <BR>
<BR>
The arrival   of the windows based computers saw the take-up of authoring and multimedia   technologies (Acorn Computers, 1993). Learning was seen to be through activity   and synthesis of material to support learning. The National Curriculum saw the   introduction of 5 strands of ICT (communicating, handling, controlling,   monitoring and measuring) and models for ICT 'delivery' as a have been discussed   in the section ICT as a subject. The 1990s saw the model of cross-curricular   delivery being promoted and also, in contrast, a return to the directed learning   and closed answers of Integrated Leaning Systems (Wood, 1998). <BR>
<BR>
In 1997   The Stevenson Report (Independent ICT in School Commission, 1997) aimed for   &ldquo;basic confidence and competence&rdquo; regarding both teachers and pupils and argued   for stability in policy. All subjects have to teach ICT (QCA, 1999). The NGfL   and latterly the Key Stage 3 (KS3) Strategy for ICT capability (DfES, 2002) saw   a renewed focus on computer suites in primary and specialist teaching in   secondary education (Kennewell et al, 2003) but issues of teacher attitudes are   still factors in the effective use of ICT across the curriculum (Williams et al,   1998) and in communication with pupils (Cunningham and Harris, 2003). Most   recently, Autumn 2004, we see the re-emergence of ICT across the curriculum   (ICTAC) in Key Stage 3. Present day challenges include the e-Learning strategy   (DfES, 2004), developments in VLEs and MLEs and a renewed interest in the   principles pedagogy (Conole et al, 2004). <BR>
<BR>
A recurring issue throughout   the history of ICT in school has been to understand the opportunities which ICT   provides for making the curriculum more accessible, for extending the   curriculum, for motivation and greater pupil control against the many   constraints on teachers in their use of ICT. Kennewell coined the term   &ldquo;affordances&rdquo; when developing a model for &ldquo;characterising ICT-based pedagogy   based on teacher orchestration of the affordances and constraints of classroom   resources&rdquo; Kennewell and Beauchamp, 2002). Those constraints include lack of ICT   skills, lack of curriculum fit and more than anything the lack of time and   energy to re think everyday routines. There are many examples showing the   successful use of ICT in school but increasing awareness of constraints on   teachers as learners (Cuban 2002) and mixed messages from government on the use   of ICT (Somekh, 2000).<BR>
<BR>
The innovations in technology have had a profound   impact upon across the curriculum use of ICT to support teaching and learning   beginning in the early part of the decade with interactive whiteboards   (Kennewell et al, 2008), remote and mobile (Naismith et al, 2004, Wishart et al,   2007) technologies and the use of virtual learning environments (Ofsted, 2009).   In parallel there have been the major research projects Becta, ImpaCT and   Testbed reporting evidence of progress.<BR>

<H1>ICT and modelling</H1>
<BR>
<strong>Introduction</strong><BR>
Modelling with the aid of   computers has become increasingly important in recent years in most areas of   science, technology, industry and business. Computer based modelling offers a   range of powerful tools for solving many global problems including climate   change, monitoring of chronic diseases, tracking offenders etc. (Brady 2009). On   the other hand over-reliance on models or failure to appreciate their   limitations can lead to unforeseen or even disastrous consequences. For example,   the credit crunch of 2008 has been attributed to failure to manage risk owing to   unrealistic expectations of financial modelling (Dan&iacute;elsson 2008). <BR>
<BR>
Given   these high stakes, understanding the nature of computer modelling and developing   modelling skills are important educational goals and have been embedded in the   National Curriculum for ICT since its inception (DfE 1995; DfEE 1999; QCA 2007).   However despite the increased availability of tools for modelling, Ofsted   reports continued to show that only a minority of ICT teachers were teaching   modelling in schools, apart from the occasional use of a simple spreadsheet   (Ofsted, 1997, 2002). Teachers in higher education have also made only limited   use of modeling for teaching and learning (Riley 2002; Riley   2007).<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Research into modelling</strong><BR>
<BR>
In the early 1990s a   significant focus of research in the UK was on the development of understanding,   skills and abilities needed for undertaking modelling tasks and understanding   modelling processes in a range of subject areas in schools (see Mellar, Bliss et   al. 1994). Research in the UK has continued to pursue some aspects of modelling   but has not been a major research focus. Perhaps modelling has been sidelined by   the more obvious learning opportunities provided by the Internet and web-based   learning. Research has included some analysis of modelling across the curriculum   (Kennewell 1997), modelling in science education (see for example van den Berg,   Ellermeijer et al. 2006) and modelling with younger children (Conlon 1999;   Goldstein and Pratt 2001). In the United States the Center for Connected   Learning and Computer-Based Modeling (CCL) (website: <A href="external.html?link=http://www.ccl.sesp.northwestern.edu/" target="blank">http://www.ccl.sesp.northwestern.edu/</A>) has been developing and   evaluating new modelling software for young learners.<BR>
<BR>
Research has   suggested that computer-based modelling offers immense potential for the   development of causal, spatial and reasoning concepts (Mellar et al, 1994). In   the National Curriculum model of progression learners are expected to progress   from using and exploring models and simulations at approximately 9-11 years old   (levels 4-5) to changing the rules and data in the models and then building   models of their own at 12 - 16 years (levels7-8) (DfE 1995; DfEE 1999; QCA   2007). There is neither a firm theoretical basis nor empirical support for this   model of progression. Indeed evidence from earlier case studies (Bliss and   Ogborn 1993; Webb 1994) suggested that children of 9 - 12 can build their own   models if they have appropriate tools. If children build their own models they   will understand better that a model is simplified, fallible, can be changed and   may need to be remade altogether (Bliss and Ogborn 1993). <BR>
<BR>
In science   education computer simulations are now widely available for exploring many   scientific phenomena and there is increasing evidence from experimental studies   that using simulations can support the development of understanding of some   scientific phenomena (Webb 2008 ). Typically simulation software permits no   access to the underlying model but recent developments in software and teaching   approaches have enabled learners to move between exploring simulations and   building models (Rogers 2006).<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Tools for modelling</strong><BR>
Tools for   modelling in science, business and industry have become increasingly powerful as   a result of developments in mathematics and computing as well as increasing   computational power (Brady 2009). Whilst much of this modelling is based on the   more standard approaches of differential and integral equations, probabilistic   and statistical modelling, Agent Based Modelling (ABM) has also become more   common. ABM has its origins in the cell automata model and the &ldquo;game of life&rdquo;   but with increasing computational power it has become possible to apply   multi-agent modelling to a range of problems in science, humanities and social   sciences (see http://www.openabm.org/site/faq for an overview). Constructing   models using ABM has been proposed as a pedagogical approach in schools and   colleges to developing understanding of complex systems (Goldstone and Wilensky   2008).<BR>
<BR>
There are now a number of tools available for children to use for   computer based modeling but most schools use only spreadsheets for modelling.   Spreadsheets are powerful modelling tools particularly suited to simple   financial modelling but they are perhaps over-emphasised as modelling tools in   schools. Alternative modelling tools include Net-logo for ABM (<A href="external.html?link=http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/" target="blank">http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/</A>), Game maker (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.mindtools.tased.edu.au/gamemaker/default.htm" target="blank">http://www.mindtools.tased.edu.au/gamemaker/default.htm</A>),   Stagecast Creator (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.stagecast.com/creator.html" target="blank">http://www.stagecast.com/creator.html</A>). For modelling in   science, tools that are more suited to modelling dynamic systems than   spreadsheets have been recommended (see Rogers 2006; Teodoro 2006 for a   discussion of various tools). <BR>
<BR>
Bliss et al., (1993) identified 3   categories of modelling tools: quantitative, semi-quantitative and qualitative   according to the need to specify relationships and factors numerically. Each   tool also has a metaphor to represent the types of objects, relationships and   actions that the system can accommodate. The selection of a modelling tool may   be a very important factor in determining the success of the modelling activity,   not only in terms of whether the learner creates a reasonable working model but   also whether the learner is helped or hindered by the software in thinking about   the problem. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>Ways forward</strong><BR>
The field is open for further   research and some key questions you might want to consider are:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&bull; What do learners understand about models and modelling?<BR>
  &bull; How   do learners interact when modelling and how does this relate to the activities   and their success in the task?<BR>
  &bull; How do teachers approach developing   modelling capability with their learners?<BR>
  &bull; How do teachers and learners   select modelling tools and tasks?<BR>
  &bull; What effects do the modelling metaphor   and the task have on learners' strategies and success in constructing   models?<BR>
  &bull; What cognitive and other skills are necessary for successful   completion of different modelling tasks?<BR>
  &bull; What metaphors do teachers and   children use to describe the process of modelling?<BR>

<H1>ICT and information handling</H1>
<BR>
Information handling in its widest   sense considers ways in which pupils search for, access, process and communicate   information within computer and non-ICT environments. It is helpful to consider   research on information handling by first looking at some general theories of   learning (Pritchard 2004); for example behaviourism constructivism and social   constructivism (Desforges 1995). These theories provide us with metaphors of how   the mind processes new information. For example is the mind an accumulator of   new knowledge, does it assimilate / adapt to new information, if adaption does   this happen through individual or social activity or both?<BR>
<BR>
In imparting   practical advice to teachers, many commentators have described information   handling in terms of cyclical processes which stress the importance of pupils   constructing &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; lines of inquiry rather than aimless browsing. NCET   materials describe the process as one of starting point; engagement; looking for   connections; asking questions; looking for answers; interpretation; product   leading to new starting points (NCET 1995). Similar approaches are discussed by   others (for example, Herring 1996) and arguably underlie the key stage 3   strategy material. <BR>
<BR>
Lynne Dagg (Kennewell, 2007, 84) raises some   interesting issues regarding exploring information:<BR>
&bull; what capabilities will   we need to explore effectively?<BR>
&bull; what does technology bring to the concept   of exploring?<BR>
&bull; how can we develop our pupils&rsquo; ability to explore through   targeted activities in school?<BR>
<BR>
She illustrates some of the strategies   through case studies. She cites research by De Bono (1996), Daniels (2001) and   Polya (1963).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
John Woollard (Kennewell, 2007, 61) considers an aspect   of handling information focused around prediction. Citing work from Adey (1994),   Leat (1998), Leask et al (2001) and Webb (2005) he addresses these areas of   handling information:<BR>
<BR>
&bull; how can we use pattern and prediction activities   in the classroom? <BR>
&bull; how can pupils make sense and draw information from a   mass of data?<BR>
&bull; what capabilities do our pupils need to analyse and predict   effectively?<BR>
&bull; what facilities does technology bring to summarising and   communicating the patterns found in data?<BR>
&bull; how can we develop our pupils&rsquo;   ability to predict through targeted activities based upon curriculum and subject   specific models and simulations?<BR>
<BR>
Some key questions to investigate   further are:<BR>
<BR>
&bull; How are specific ICT skills (such as the use of search   engines) best taught to children?<BR>
&bull; How do interpret information in ICT / non   ICT environments?<BR>
&bull; How can we best develop information support services in   schools?<BR>
&bull; Where are the opportunities / difficulties in planning for   engagement in information handling?<BR>
