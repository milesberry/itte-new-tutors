<H2>Citizenship - Rationale</H2>
<p><br>
  In this article about the relationship between information and communication technology (ICT) and citizenship education the emphasis is on those aspects of ICT that generate questions and debates about effective citizenship (<i>ICT as practice</i>) or those aspects of ICT that show how ICT can support citizenship education (<i>ICT as a Key Skill</i>).<br><br>It is written to be relevant to any phase of initial teacher education (ITE) because first and foremost it is a crucial professional requirement that all trainee teachers acquire an understanding of the social, ethical and political significance of ICT. Second but equally important is the fact that pupils in school today have potentially high expectations about the effective and interesting use of ICT in their learning. Trainee teachers, whether Foundation Phase, Primary, Secondary or subject specialists, are in the vanguard of the effort to meet these aspirations.<br><br>Thus, throughout this article the generic term 'trainee teacher'  or 'trainee' refers to any phase of training. It is of course up to the tutor and the trainees to consider the appropriateness of suggested classroom activities for a particular age range, but considered reflexively the issues are common to all trainees.<br><br>Occasional paragraphs in italics are intended to be broad suggestions for ICT tutors on which they might build discussion or practical work with their trainees:<br><br>
  <i>At the beginning of their course many trainees will not have considered the social, ethical and political issues relating to ICT use in everyday life. They may not have reflected on these issues in relation to their own ICT capability or the pedagogy of ICT. How important is ICT to a good education in the 21st Century? </i><br><br>Citizenship education presents the ICT tutor and trainee with a very large range of interesting topics and experiments that can greatly enrich their curriculum, whether for subject specialists or the more generalist primary teacher.<br><br>In so doing, new ICT teachers will become more extended. They need to be aware that ICT is much more than merely manipulating software. They need to understand and to take a position on the way in which ICT is intimately woven into many significant moral and political questions that are a part of everyday life. <b>ICT is social practice much more than it is a technical function.</b><br><br>Thus, throughout this resources tutors and trainees should consider:<br><br>1. How citizenship education arises in teaching ICT as a subject.<br>2. How ICT can support the teaching and learning of citizenship.<br><br>
  <i>As a coursework assignment ask your trainees to track the newspapers, television news, online newsfeeds, and related media  for stories that link ICT to everyday social controversy. Look for topics such as plagiarism, identity theft, data mismanagement, public expenditure on IT systems, governmental interference in or facilitation of information systems, the arguments about the positive or negative effects of computer games and their value for learning, changes in language habits, the impact of ICT on everyday economic activity such as shopping or on copyright issues in the arts. (This might be handled as a group wiki or a personal blog).</i><br><br>All sources and resources referred to are listed in the Resources section at the end of this article, plus additional sources not referred to directly.<br><br>For a significant general resource relevant to teacher education see the TDA sponsored website <a href="external.html?link=http://www.citized.info/" target="blank">CitizED: Citizenship Education and Teacher Education</a>.<br><br><br>A composite document of this resource is available and may be downloaded using the link below.<br>author: David Longman<br>

<H1>Background</H1>
<BR>
Citizenship has been a statutory foundation subject of   the National Curriculum in England at Key Stages 3-4 since September 2002. In   Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland it is not a separate subject but remains   embedded within the PSHE curriculum.<BR>
<BR>
The context for the emergence of   citizenship education as a general educational concern is the same for all. At   root is a long term trend that indicates a declining engagement between people   and the democratic political system by which we live. This includes such   elements as a long term decline in participation rates in civil and voluntary   organisations as well as voting rates in general and local elections, sometimes   referred to as the democratic deficit.<BR>
<BR>
As a response to these concerns,   on its election in 1997, the new Labour government set up the <strong>Advisory Group   on Citizenship and the Teaching of Democracy in School</strong>. The Advisory Group   was chaired by Sir Bernard Crick and its report, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.teachingcitizenship.org.uk/dnloads/crickreport1998.pdf" target="blank">Education for Citizenship and the Teaching of Democracy in   Schools</A> (1998) is thus known as the <strong>Crick Report</strong>.<BR>
<BR>
Labour's own   electoral success itself provided evidence for the decline in political   engagement. Not only was its victory based on a very low turnout but the   demographic group that voted least was the newly enfranchised 18- to   25-year-olds (Independent, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/citizenship--bernard-crick-citizenship-must-begin-to-replace-ethos-in-the-classroom-607615.html" target="blank">'Citizenship must begin to replace ethos in the classroom'</A> 27/9/2002).<BR>
<BR>
In England the Crick Report led to the formation of the new   National Curriculum foundation subject, citizenship, statutory at Key Stages 3   and 4 and advisory at Key Stages 1 and 2. The details of the National Curriculum   requirements in England, revised in 2008, can be viewed at the <A href="external.html?link=http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/" target="blank">National   Curriculum website</A>. For Key Stage 3 and 4 the curriculum is organised around   key concepts and key processes (Key Stages 1 and 2 remain as they were for the   1999 version of the curriculum). The curriculum has three main areas of   focus:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI>social and moral responsibility  
    <LI>community involvement  
    <LI>political literacy</LI>
  </UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In Wales, for example, citizenship   is embedded in <A href="external.html?link=http://www.esd-wales.org.uk/" target="blank">Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship</A> and there is a strong focus on <BR>
values education:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although there is no explicit Welsh approach to the promotion of   social responsibility, there are a large number of education initiatives that   have the development of values at their heart. The expectation is that schools   should play an important role in promoting these values in young people through   the range and quality of the experiences they provide and by actively engaging   young people through consultation in the education they receive.<BR>

While there are differences between   the countries of the UK, a key issue for ICT tutors is that although you may be   working with trainees who are intending to become specialist ICT teachers, as   well as generalist primary teachers, there are a variety of contexts in which   citizenship education will appear and where ICT expertise will be applied: <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><strong>Where and how will citizenship education   happen?</strong><BR>
  Everywhere. It's up to schools to plan the delivery of   citizenship. It can happen:
  <UL>
    <LI>through a whole-school approach in curriculum time  
    <LI>via dedicated citizenship lessons  
    <LI>through existing subjects, e.g. PSHE, history, geography, RE and science  
    <LI>through the National Healthy School Standard Initiative  
    <LI>through the Key Stage 3 Strategy  
    <LI>in extra-curricular activities and special events.  
    <LI>in the community  
    <LI>at home  
    <LI>through volunteering</LI>

<H1>Aspects of Citizenship Education</H1>
<BR>
In a very useful literature review, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.futurelab.org.uk/resources/documents/lit_reviews/Citizenship_Review.pdf" target="blank">Selwyn (2004)</A> distinguishes several important aspects of   citizenship education. These distinctions are helpful to the ICT tutor in   identifying the ways in which ICT can contribute to the subject area. <A href="external.html?link=http://www.futurelab.org.uk/resources/documents/lit_reviews/Citizenship_Review_update.pdf" target="blank">Selwyn (2007)</A> updates this review. Both reviews should be   regarded as key texts for ICT trainees.<BR>
<BR>
This article makes use of   Selwyn's classification which distinguishes between passive and active   approaches to citizenship education referring to the level of participation and   activity not only by students and pupils but also by the school and the   teacher.<BR>
<BR>
The Crick report itself was emphatic that it is not sufficient   to produce good citizens but also active citizens, hence, for example, the   emphasis on community involvement that runs throughout curriculum formulations   of citizenship education.<BR>
<BR>
The diagram illustrates Selwyn's basic   scheme:<BR>
<BR>
------------------ Passive --------------------------------Active   -----------------<BR>
.......Education...........................Education......................Education<BR>
...about   citizenship............through citizenship..........for   citizenship<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
<em>Many   trainees will not have given any or much consideration to how, as teachers,   their own level of participation and engagement may be expressed through their   teaching.</em><BR>
<BR>
The key process skills that make up ICT capability are a   significant contribution that ICT brings to citizenship education. All the UK   National Curriculums promote similar common skills and processes in ICT, along   with their application and development in a range of contexts and levels:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/key-stages-3-and-4/subjects/ict/index.aspx" target="blank">England:</A> Finding, developing, communicating and evaluating   information.  
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://wales.gov.uk/topics/educationandskills/curriculumassessment/arevisedcurriculumforwales/nationalcurriculum/ictnc/?lang=en" target="blank">Wales:</A> Finding, analysing, creating and communicating   information.  
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://www.nicurriculum.org.uk/skills_and_capabilities/ict.asp" target="blank">Northern Ireland:</A> Explore, express, exchange, evaluate and   exhibit information.  
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/ictineducation/index.asp" target="blank">Scotland:</A> Searching and researching, communicating,   collaborating,creating and presenting information.</LI>
</UL>
Thus, ICT is at the   heart of any learning activity in citizenship education (and potentially for all   subjects) all the way from the simple gathering of information (Education about   citizenship) to the researching, recombining, and communication of information   (Education for citizenship).<BR>
<BR>
Pupils, students, trainees, and teachers   need to be capable of using information dynamically and in a variety of   contexts. It is through the meaningful and critical that active, participatory   citizenship education can develop. <BR>
<BR>
While there is a little more   diversity in the design and content of citizenship education curriculums across   the United Kingdom, there are common process skills, which in their turn are   very similar to those key skills in ICT (perhaps a little more explicit in the   English and Welsh versions):<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/key-stages-3-and-4/subjects/citizenship/keystage3/index.aspx" target="blank">England:</A> Critical thinking and enquiry, advocacy and   representation, taking informed and responsible action  
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://www.esd-wales.org.uk/english/higher_ed/teacher_education/integrating_ESDGC/concepts.htm" target="blank">Wales:</A> Critical thinking, co-operation, argument, respect  
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://www.nicurriculum.org.uk/connected_learning/thematic_units/index.asp" target="blank">Northern Ireland:</A> In Northern Ireland citizenship is dispersed   throughout the curriculum as a theme and interlocks with a range of related   themes such as personal understanding, sustainable development, cultural   understanding etc.  
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/citizenship/index.asp" target="blank">Scotland:</A> In a similar way the Scottish citizenship curriculum   is a broad-based approach including such themes as participation, community,   active learning.</LI>
</UL>
<p>ICT teachers are in a special position because they   are well placed to teach learners how to undertake effective information   research, which is both a key process skill in ICT and in citizenship   education.<BR>
  <BR>
  Thus ICT teachers have to teach it well.<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>Like all   schemes this one should be taken critically. Trainees should skim and review the   various approaches to ICT and citizenship in the curriculums of the United   Kingdom. Map ICT process skills onto citizenship process skills. What features   do they all share in common (e.g. processes and skills) and in what ways do they   differ? Trainees should also be encouraged to discuss such issues as: To what   extent are the key ICT process skills of finding, retrieving and communicating   information essential for effective citizenship education? To what extent, for   example, might students' employability be enhanced if they can carry out fast,   efficient Google searches?<BR>

<H1>ICT and eCitizenship</H1>
<BR>
Perhaps most obviously, ICT itself can be a   topic of study within citizenship education as well as within ICT curricula. ICT   is widely perceived to have had a dramatic and far reaching impact on global   society. Life as a citizen in the contemporary world may be increasingly   difficult without the use of ICT in some form, hence the notion of <A href="external.html?link=http://www.e-citizen.gov.uk/" target="blank">e-citizenship</A>. The lack of access to and availability of ICT in   many parts of society, locally and globally, may already have generated a <A href="external.html?link=http://www.digitaldivide.org/dd/index.html" target="blank">digital divide</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Some key aspects of dealing with ICT as   a topic of study would include:
<UL>
  <LI>The social and political implications of ICT for individuals  
  <LI>The implications of ICT for government and democracy  
  <LI>The influence of social, cultural, political and economic forces on ICT  
  <LI>Equality of access to and the use of ICT  
  <LI>The role of ICT in political power and control  
  <LI>Historical perspectives on the development of new technologies as well as   their future potential.</LI>
</UL>
Throughout this article a familiarity with and   awareness of the huge range of ICT tools, applications and environments is   assumed. Any teacher or trainee, whether subject specialist or not, should keep   abreast of the evolving nature of ICT. Even today many teachers will assume that   ICT begins and ends with office-style applications of one form or another   (wordprocessing, spreadsheets, graphics and paint etc).<BR>
<BR>
But the power and   importance of what is known as Web 2.0 must be fully exploited and understood.   Social networks such as <A href="external.html?link=http://www.bebo.com/" target="blank">Bebo</A> and <A href="external.html?link=http://www.facebook.com/" target="blank">Facebook</A>, virtual worlds such as <A href="external.html?link=http://www.secondlife.com/" target="blank">Second   Life</A> and <A href="external.html?link=http://www.habbo.co.uk/" target="blank">Habbo Hotel</A>, online writing and publishing (both individual and   collaborative) through blogs, wikis, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.youtube.com/" target="blank">YouTube</A>, or   shared tools such as <A href="external.html?link=http://docs.google.com/" target="blank">Google Docs</A> all drive the use of ICT towards citizenship   issues.<BR>
<BR>
And <A href="external.html?link=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6241603.stm" target="blank">mobile technologies</A> must not be overlooked. The mobile phone is   today the single most used tool for communication by young people and likely to   become a major driver for social and economic development across the globe in   less affluent nations.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Trainee teachers must appreciate and understand   the significance of these technologies for learning and for their pupils' future   role as employees, artists, voters, policy makers etc. It is essential that all   courses of initial teacher training ensure that trainees gain experience in   using these technologies and that they develop a critical understanding of their   value.</em><BR>

<H1>ICT and Education About Citizenship</H1>
<BR>
Education about citizenship   broadly aims to impart information and knowledge about key elements of the   citizenship education curriculum and to raise awareness through familiarisation   with recognisable skills, ideas, and attitudes. It is about <strong>critical thinking   and enquiry</strong>.<BR>
<BR>
While important, in Selwyn's scheme these aims could be   achieved with relatively low levels of participation by pupils, and thus a more   passive style of learning.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Trainees should consider the different ways   in which citizenship education can be taught. How do different learning and   teaching contexts affect the degree of learner participation?</em><BR>
<BR>
ICT   teachers can contribute some key process skills that can help facilitate even   the most basic of these aims. They may be summarised as:<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>
  <strong>Finding, retrieving and communicating   information</strong>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
However, there is ample evidence to suggest that   these process skills are not being acquired even by the so-called Google   Generation. So these skills cannot be taken for granted by teachers. Young   learners may appear to be adept <BR>
digital natives but this is usually in a   highly non-critical manner. <BR>
<BR>
Nor can teachers assume that they are fluent   in these process skills themselves. Research evidence also indicates that   mature, professional users of web-based information sources lack proficiency   too.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Trainee teachers may not have given much consideration to their   own skill and effectiveness when finding, processing and using information.   Trainees should, therefore, be given opportunities to reflect on this. Examples   might include academic activities such as library and journal searches, using   search engines, or collecting and using a bibliographic database, but also such   everyday activities as shopping for items on Amazon, using email to correspond   with others, some sort of social networking, maintaining bookmark lists   etc.</em><BR>
<BR>
To help trainees develop a more informed awareness of the   current range and level of information gathering skills, reference should be   made to the Google Generation Project carried out at <A href="external.html?link=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/research/ciber/" target="blank">UCL CIBER</A> and subsequently published as <A href="external.html?link=http://www.facetshop.co.uk/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=1&Product_Code=651-0&Category_Code=" target="blank">Digital Consumers</A> <BR>
<BR>
While citizenship education should   begin in the early years, the opportunities for finding, retrieving and   communicating information are less direct and need to be carefully constructed   for young learners. However, young learners do need to develop their aptitude   with basic navigational skills as early as possible. <A href="external.html?link=http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/citizenship/about/curriculum/earlyyears/index.asp" target="blank">Learning and Teaching Scotland</A> has some useful starting points   for citizenship education in the early years.<BR>
<BR>
As children mature during   KS2 the process skills of searching, retrieving and using information can be   progressively elaborated. The TDA sponsored website <A href="external.html?link=http://www.citized.info/?strand=0&r_menu=about" target="blank">CitizED</A> is an important starting point for trainee teachers to   begin to think about what sort of information sources may be useful and relevant   both in their role as ICT subject teachers (such sources can form the basis for   effective ICT teaching) and also more widely in helping to inform or work with   citizenship education colleagues.<BR>

<H1>ICT and Education Through Citizenship</H1>
<BR>
Complementary to the previous   section on the acquisition of knowledge and understanding about citizenship is   the way in which ICT can promote a more active learning by doing in citizenship   education, i.e. participation in activities within school, in the local   community or beyond. Through greater participation, knowledge and understanding   are contextualised and pupils will learn that there are often no straightforward   answers to many difficult issues. <strong>Advocacy and representation</strong> are   therefore key capabilities in citizenship.<BR>
<BR>
In <em>Education About   Citizenship</em> the use of ICT should be, from the outset, a key tool in   searching for, retrieving, and organising information and should include and   promote a critical attitude towards information sources in order to evaluate   it.<BR>
<BR>
In <em>Education Through Citizenship</em> the role of ICT in supporting   and enabling <strong>debate and discussion</strong> becomes crucial. The ICT teacher can   contribute significantly to citizenship education by ensuring that pupils can,   to a high order, <BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>
  <strong>Express, exchange, evaluate and exhibit information (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.nicurriculum.org.uk/connected_learning/thematic_units/index.asp" target="blank">Northern Ireland</A>)</strong>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
Debate and discussion is   a central method in citizenship education although it can be challenging to   implement it fully and effectively in classroom settings. ICT can add   considerable value to these key processes by helping pupils to focus on what   makes communication effective across a number of dimensions:<BR>
<BR>
<strong>ICT as a   resource creator</strong>: Communication, discussion and debate rely on the capacity   to represent and express ideas and information in a variety of styles and   media.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Trainees should analyse the variety of different ways that ICT   can engage pupils in creating resources and emphasising, naturally, the   potential of multimedia to support a wide variety of communication styles and   contexts. Citizenship education provides a range of opportunities for authentic   learning to take place both within school and the local community. Trainees   should be able to identify some of these, particularly in relation to their   placement schools.</em><BR>
<BR>
<strong>ICT as a medium of communication</strong>: ICT is,   as its name implies, a medium of communication. Trainees should learn to make   effective and creative use of the extensive range of channels it affords both   for general professional purposes and in the content of their   teaching.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Trainees should be able to enumerate and describe the wide a   range of ICT communication channels that are available and they should become as   adept as possible at using at least some of them. They should be able to explain   the difference between one-one, one-many, and many-many channels, synchronous   and asynchronous modes, and understand the relative merits of different contexts   in which text, voice and image can be combined to communicate with peers or a   wider audience (e.g. social networking versus email). They should also   understand and develop strategies for managing the safe use of such tools and   should know how to educate pupils in the safe use of ICT for communicating with   others. In this last respect trainees should appreciate that they, too, are   responsible for teaching citizenship education directly because the safe and   responsible use of ICT is a key element of a just society. Some key sources that   address these aspects and that trainees should read are <A href="external.html?link=http://emergingtechnologies.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=etr&catcode=ETRE_0001&rid=14122" target="blank">Web 2.0 technologies for learning at KS3 and KS4</A> (Becta) and <A href="external.html?link=http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/byronreview/" target="blank">Safer   Children in a Digital World (the Byron Review)</A>.</em><BR>
<BR>
<strong>ICT as a   source of role play and simulation</strong>: Selwyn (2007) also includes here the use   of ICT in providing activities that simulate relevant citizenship processes or   provide opportunities for role play. <A href="external.html?link=http://www.simsweatshop.com/" target="blank">Sim*Sweatshop</A> affords a simple example and the UN/IDSR   simulation <A href="external.html?link=http://www.stopdisastersgame.org/en/home.html" target="blank">Stop Disasters!</A> a more elaborate one.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Trainees should   appreciate that a variety of ICT-based opportunities exist that rely on the use   of the computer as a tool for exploring 'as-if' or 'what-if' scenarios. The <A href="external.html?link=http://thinkingtogether.educ.cam.ac.uk/" target="blank">Thinking Together Project</A> is a good example of resources   developed for primary pupils where scenarios are combined with a structured   approach to teaching pupils about how to hold a discussion. ICT is incorporated   in this project, e.g. see <A href="external.html?link=http://thinkingtogether.educ.cam.ac.uk/resources/KATEPC.zip" target="blank">Kate's Choice</A>.</em><BR>

<H1>ICT and Education for Citizenship</H1>
<p><BR>
  Trainees will begin to acquire an   important and useful body of aims and objectives to cover any phase of ICT   teaching when they consider the use of ICT for <strong>critical thinking and   enquiry</strong> in learning and teaching <strong>about</strong> citizenship, and the use of   ICT to understand and apply <strong>advocacy and representation</strong> in learning <strong>through</strong> citizenship .<BR>
  <BR>
  The importance of the <strong>practice</strong> of   citizenship is, thus, explicit through all the National Curricula for   citizenship in the UK.<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>By this point, trainees should have considered   to what degree ICT is made more socially purposeful by using it to support at   least some of the aims of citizenship education. In particular, trainees should   recognise how many practical classroom activities in citizenship arise from the   use of a variety of ICT tools and resources, and that these classroom   opportunities are possible across all phases of education. The effect of <strong>prevailing institutional policies</strong> (e.g. see Becta's <A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=is" target="blank">E-safety materials</A>) on the effective use of ICT should also be   considered. To what extent do schools' organisational and operational policies   for ICT use hinder or promote the use of networked communications beyond and   within the school?</em><BR>
  <BR>
  <em>Subject specialist ICT trainees intending to   teach at Key Stage 4 and beyond should review examples of qualification   specifications that they might typically encounter as teachers. To what extent   do ICT qualifications promote citizenship values, or is there a predominantly   commercial and technical orientation? To what extent could topics and processes   in citizenship education enhance ICT programmes of study for   pupils?</em><BR>
  <BR>
  According to Selwyn, there is scope for some very interesting   and innovative work to be done in encouraging the use of ICT in pursuit of an   even more participative approach to citizenship education. In the right kind of   school context and with the right kind of approach to teaching, ICT is a   fantastic resource, medium and tool through which pupils can learn to take   informed and responsible action (<A href="external.html?link=http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/key-stages-3-and-4/subjects/citizenship/keystage4/index.aspx?return=/key-stages-3-and-4/subjects/citizenship/index.aspx" target="blank">Citizenship Key Stage 4, Section 2.3, England</A>).<BR>
  <BR>
  Perhaps   one of the more relevant and immediate contexts within which this strand of   citizenship education can be developed is the school itself. After all, the   school and classroom are key sites of learning about power, authority, control   and ideas about fairness and justice. To be fit for the 21st century the school   and the school curriculum must address such citizenship issues as   personalisation of learning, sustainable development, diversity and inclusion,   among others.<BR>
  <BR>
  Here the role of ICT in promoting, enabling and   facilitating student voice is a relatively untapped aspect of ICT in citizenship   education. Organisations such as the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.studentvoice.co.uk/" target="blank">English   Secondary Students' Association</A> or the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.schoolcouncils.org/" target="blank">School   Councils UK</A> both rely heavily on the assumption that students in schools   will have access to ICT for engaging in and promoting informed and responsible   action within education itself. In Wales the <A href="external.html?link=http://new.wales.gov.uk/docrepos/40382/40382313/childrenyoungpeople/403821/item_20f_20english.pdf?lang=en" target="blank">Extending Entitlement</A> policy sets out 10 basic entitlements   and, through the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.schoolcouncilswales.org.uk/" target="blank">School Councils Wales</A> initiative, actively promotes the   participation of pupils in representing the views of learners about their   education and schooling. <BR>

  <em>Trainees should consider how online forums,   online questionnaire, and even such recent tools as <A href="external.html?link=http://twitter.com/" target="blank">Twitter</A>, might be   more effectively deployed in the context of pupils' participation in   representation (and perhaps limited decision making) within school. Though   completed and already a little dated, a valuable research oriented approach to   the idea of student voice in learning and teaching can be reviewed at the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.consultingpupils.co.uk/" target="blank">ESRC   Network Project</A>. Trainees engaged on higher level work (e.g. M Level   projects in PGCE programmes) could develop an ICT-based research project around   an investigation into student voice. </em><BR>
