  <b>Rationale</B><br><br>This resource is designed to look across a number of topics and educational initiatives at the issue of personalisation. It is designed in such a way as it can be used as a unit of work with trainee teachers. Alternatively aspects of it might be included where the related issues are raised in the Initial Teacher Education (ITE) curriculum. This resource is not intended to help tutors in ITE develop a personalised curriculum for their own trainee teachers. It is rather a teaching resource for tutors in Primary or Secondary ITE who teach Information Technology or Learning Technology. Although the issues are not in any way exclusive to Information or Learning Technology as a subject, ICT it seems, will play a very significant role in a more personalised learning environment. For this reason the issue is highly pertinent to those training to teach ICT as a subject or to use it in their teaching.<br><br>author: Helena Gillespie and John Woollard<br>

<H1>1. What is personalisation?</H1>
<BR>
<CENTER>
  The nature of educational provision for personalised   learning
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>1.1 The drivers for personalisation</strong><BR>
<BR>
There   are many aspects to the emerging personalisation agenda in schools. <BR>
The   following represents some of the areas that are most pertinent to initial   teacher training. <BR>
<BR>
A definition:<BR>
<BR>
<em>&ldquo;Personalisation is&hellip;about   putting citizens at the heart of public services and enabling them to have a say   in the design and improvement of the organisations that serve them. In education   this can be understood as personalised learning &ndash; the drive to tailor education   to individual need, interest and aptitude so as to fulfil every young person&rsquo;s   potential&rdquo;. </em>DfES (2004)<BR>
<BR>
This was reflected by the then Minister of   State for School Standards, David Miliband, <BR>
<BR>
<em>&ldquo;Decisive progress in   educational standards occurs where every child matters; careful attention is   paid to their individual learning styles, motivations, and needs; there is   rigorous use of student target setting linked to high quality assessment;   lessons are well paced and enjoyable; and students are supported by partnership   with others well beyond the classroom.&rdquo; </em>(Miliband, 2004) <BR>
<BR>
The   personalisation agenda is part of a number of current initiatives and   developments. It is not an initiative in itself, but an important driver in many   of the current changes taking place in many spheres of education. It is   important to begin to consider personalisation by understanding what it could   mean, and what it doesn&rsquo;t mean.<BR>
<BR>
Personalisation DOESN&rsquo;T mean:
<UL>
  <LI>Teachers planning separately for each of their learners  
  <LI>Learners being left to their own devices  
  <LI>Everyone must learn in the same place (at school or away from   school).</LI>
</UL>
Personalisation DOES mean:
<UL>
  <LI>New ways of teaching and learning could be used and pedagogies that mix a   range of styles and strategies could be employed at the same time  
  <LI>An understanding of learner needs is at the heart of the process  
  <LI>Learning technologies could play a significant part in enabling teachers to   achieve a personalised approach.</LI>
</UL>
Every Child Matters (ECM) is one the   most important documents to be published for educators in the last few years.   The ECM document and its subsequent agenda is working towards meeting children&rsquo;s   and families&rsquo; needs in order to help all children achieve their potential as   members of society. Education is one part of this, and the aim is to help all   children achieve successful outcomes in their education. A more personalised   approach to their learning should help them do this. For this reason it is   important for trainee teachers to understand the scope of the document and its   influence on current educational thinking.<BR>

<BR>
<strong>1.2 Issues for reflection and   consideration</strong><BR>
<BR>
Students should consider in what ways they have seen   evidence of a personalised approach to learning in their placement schools. It   would be useful to look at this in the context of the ECM documents and consider   how schools and teachers could make progress in personalising   learning.<BR>

<H1>2. What is a personalised curriculum? </H1>
<BR>
<CENTER>
  The curriculum as experienced by teachers and   learners
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
This page, Section 2, looks at ways in which the   existing curriculum can be related to personalisation (2.3). To put this in   context trainee teachers should have an understanding of how personalisation   related to learning theories (2.1) and have an overview of the current debates   around learner voice (2.2). Allied to all of this are developments in assessment   for learning and in e-portfolios (2.4) <BR>
<BR>
<strong>2.1 Personalisation and   theories of learning</strong><BR>
<BR>
Learner centred modes of education have been the   dominant education theories of the past 40 years. The majority of teachers   currently working in schools underwent their training when teacher education was   based around constructivist theories. More recently trained teachers might also   be aware of the theories of metacognition and of theories of multiple   intelligences. A useful and succinct overview of these learning theories in   Bartlett and Burton&rsquo;s Introduction to Education Studies is useful in   understanding how education theories have developed. The personalisation agenda   fits with these theories in a number of ways:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&bull; Constructivist theories of education (such as those of Vygotsky   and Bruner) emphasise the need to start with what the learner knows and can do   and to build upon that. Crucial aspects of this pedagogical approach are that   the teacher should understand the learner and be able to help move their   learning forward (scaffold) in the right ways. This approach is clearly linked   with a personalised approach to learning.<BR>
  <BR>
  &bull; Metacognition is a learning   theory that emphasises the need for a learner to understand their own learning   process in order to move it forward. As with constructivism, the learner and the   teacher need to enter into a dialogue about the learning that is taking place.   This dialogue will be personal to each learner as they engage with the   teacher.<BR>
  <BR>
  &bull; Theories around different learning styles and different types   of &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo; have been developing apace in recent times. One of the most   popular is that of Howard Gardener who theorised that there are eight different   ways in which a person can be intelligent. This theory, and others, have been   distilled into a theory which is commonly held by primary school teachers, that   is that some learners learn best Visually, some learn best in an Auditory way,   and others in a physical or Kinaesthetic way (popularly known as the VAK   theory). Whether or not learners can fit neatly into such categories, most   teachers know that different approaches to learning with a range of media are   needed for each individual learner.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Further discussion about   learner styles and approaches to teaching and learning is available on this site   in <A href="text_only949b.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=0&ts=1">Teaching   and Learning</A> and <A href="text_onlya081.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=7&ts=6">Models   of Teaching - models and theories</A><BR>
<BR>
<strong>2.2 Listening to learner&rsquo;s   voices</strong><BR>
<BR>
In order to personalise learning effectively, the learners   need to be listened to. There have been a number of publications looking into   how this might effect education. One is exemplified in the Futurelab Handbook on <A href="external.html?link=http://www.futurelab.org.uk/resources/publications-reports-articles/handbooks/Handbook132" target="blank">Learner Voice</A>, which sets out why learner voice is important   for the education system. In summary:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&bull; Listening to learners&rsquo; voices helps develop a clearer identity and   ethos in a school<BR>
  <BR>
  &bull; Listening to learners&rsquo; voices can and should   contribute to school development<BR>
  <BR>
  &bull; Listening to learners&rsquo; voices   encourages better student engagement with school in general<BR>
  <BR>
  &bull; Listening   to learner&rsquo;s voices improves staff/learner relationships<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
It   seems that listening to learners and including them more thoroughly as   stakeholders in their own learning can have many benefits. Digital technologies   can support this where they facilitate communications within learner groups and   between learners and teachers. It may be that technologies such as Virtual   Learning Environments (see section 4) which provide tools for synchronous &lsquo;chat&rsquo;   and asynchronous &lsquo;discussion forums&rsquo; may be an ideal way of facilitating   teacher/learner talk in a non-threatening way. In addition, where learners are   able to have an input into modes of assessment (in self assessment) they are   more likely to be successful in those forms of assessment.<BR>
<BR>
BECTA have   recently published (2008) <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh&catcode=_re_rp_02&rid=14551" target="blank">a study on learner perspective</A> including recommendations and   policy implications which should be considered. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>2.3 Curriculum   reform</strong><BR>
<BR>
2.3.1 Personalisation and the ICT Curriculum<BR>
<BR>
This   section looks at how curriculum and assessment reform could lead to a more   personalised curriculum. The focus is mainly on curriculum reform in the   secondary sector, but there are issues for the primary phase too. In addition it   looks at how teachers can plan, teach and assess pupils' learning using   technology to meet their needs.<BR>
<BR>
The <A href="external.html?link=http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/personalisedlearning/" target="blank">DCSF Standards site</A> has a mini site for personalised learning   linked to curriculum initiatives and reform. Trainee teachers and tutors in ITE   should regard this as their first stop in looking for news and developments on   the personalisation agenda. <BR>
<BR>
The five components are split into three   &lsquo;inner core&rsquo; components that relate to classroom practice:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&bull; Assessment for Learning<BR>
  &bull; Effective teaching and learning   strategies<BR>
  &bull; Curriculum entitlement and choice<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Two more   components relate to the wider educational experience:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&bull; Organising the school<BR>
  &bull; Beyond the classroom<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
A   good starting point for resources and reflections upon personalisation is the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/p/personalisedlearning/" target="blank">TeacherNet website</A>. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<em>Five key components of   personalised learning<BR>
Source: Personalised Learning TLRP/ESRC 2004, Editors   James, A &amp; Pollard, A </em><BR>
<BR>
The essence of personalisation is that   learning systems conform to the learner and not the learner having to conform to   the system of teaching. The &ldquo;Personalisation and Digital Technologies&rdquo; report   (Green et al, 2005) moves the personalisation debate forward by focusing   specifically on the potential of digital technologies in four key areas: <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&bull; enabling learners to make informed educational choices<BR>
  &bull;   diversifying and acknowledging different forms of skills and knowledge <BR>
  &bull;   creating diverse learning environments<BR>
  &bull; developing learner-focused forms of   assessment and feedback. <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
From September 2008 changes to the Key   Stage 3 and Key Stage 4 curriculum have been phased in. These constitute both   changes in the pedagogical approach to this phase of education and the   curriculum content. Crucially, they also affect modes of assessment. Trainee   teachers should consider the links between the aims and content of the   curriculum as set out below and the issues of personalisation. Learning   technologies that can be used for personalisation, specifically Virtual Learning   Environments (VLE) and mobile devices, and their use, raise some interesting   issues. Such issues are referred to in the ICT curriculum and have implications   for both ICT as a subject and ICT in other subject areas. Trainees may need help   to understand the implications for teaching and learning of these technologies.   Their primary focus will be within their own practice, but they need also to be   aware that those who teach ICT may be expected to support colleagues in   developing the technical and pedagogical skills to use these   technologies.<BR>

<BR>
The new aims for   the curriculum, which relate directly to the outcomes of Every Child Matters,   are that:<BR>
<BR>
The curriculum should enable all young people to become:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&bull; Successful learners who enjoy learning, make progress and   achieve<BR>
  &bull; Confident individuals who are able to live safe, healthy and   fulfilling lives<BR>
  &bull; Responsible citizens who make a positive contribution to   society.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Trainees teachers should consider to what extent the   ICT curriculum helps pupils achieve these aims, and to what extent pupils&rsquo;   experiences of the ICT curriculum need to be personalised in order to achieve   these aims. It might be useful to look at specific parts of the ICT curriculum   rather than at the curriculum as a whole in order to focus ideas and discussion.   For example, tutors could look at the following elements:<BR>
<BR>
From the Key   Concepts of the Key Stage 3 Programme of Study:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em><BR>
  1.4 Impact of technology<BR>
  <BR>
  a. Exploring how ICT changes   the way we live our lives and has significant social, ethical and cultural   implications.<BR>
  <BR>
  b. Recognising issues of risk, safety and responsibility   surrounding the use of ICT.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
From the Key Concepts of the   Key Stage 4 Programme of Study:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em><BR>
  1.5 Critical evaluation<BR>
  <BR>
  a. Recognising that   information must not be taken at face value, but must be analysed and evaluated   to take account of its purpose, author, currency and context.<BR>
  <BR>
  b.   Reviewing and reflecting critically on what they and others produce using   ICT.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
In addition, the key stage 2 National Curriculum   for ICT introduces some of the issues and topics raised by these elements of the   secondary phase of the ICT curriculum. Specifically:<BR>
<BR>
From the Key Stage 2   Statutory Content:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em><BR>
  Exchanging and sharing information<BR>
  <BR>
  3. Pupils should be   taught:<BR>
  <BR>
  a. how to share and exchange information in a variety of forms,   including e-mail [for example, displays, posters, animations, musical   compositions]<BR>
  <BR>
  b. to be sensitive to the needs of the audience and think   carefully about the content and quality when communicating information [for   example, work for presentation to other pupils, writing for parents, publishing   on the internet].<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Curriculum documents should be   considered by trainees, for example, the Review of the Primary Curriculum, KS3   changes, 14-19 reform. While the changes at Key Stage 3 are now embedded in   schools, reform in the 14-19 age range as a result of the Tomlinson Report of   2004 is ongoing with a drive towards offering more flexible and diverse routes   through education for those nearing the end of their schooling. In late 2008,   the publication of the Independent Review of the Primary Curriculum seems   destined to indicate significant curriculum and pedagogical change in the   Primary phase too.<BR>

<strong>2.3.2 ICT supporting learning in other   subjects</strong><BR>
<BR>
While personalisation raises issues for ICT as a subject in   itself, trainee teachers should also consider how ICT is used in other subjects   and how this relates to personalised learning. In 2004, as part of the KS3   curriculum reform, a guide to ICT in other subjects across the curriculum was   introduced. The overview and guide for management of this initiative is   available at:<BR>
<BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/secondary/keystage3/all/respub/ictac" target="blank">ICTAC</A> initiative on the Standards Site<BR>
<BR>
Secondary school   ICT teachers may be involved in helping develop whole school ICT policy and   practice. In particular, teachers of ICT need to develop pupils&rsquo; transferable   ICT skills, in order that they are able to apply what they learn in a variety of   curriculum subjects. In considering this issue, tutors in ITE might ask the   trainees to look at specific ICT tools and application and how they might be   included in other subjects and in whole school pedagogical approaches. Two good   examples (discussed further in section 4 of this unit) are how schools can make   use of virtual learning environments and mobile technologies in this way,   especially the impact that such technologies can have on pupil assessment. The   following questions might be useful:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&bull; In what ways could online testing via a VLE help secure and   develop pupils&rsquo; subject knowledge in Science?<BR>
  &bull; How could mobile learning   technologies such as phones or PDAs help develop pupils&rsquo; work in Geography?<BR>
  &bull;   How could electronic portfolios support cross-curricular   learning?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Trainees might like to refer to individual subject's   ICTAC documents available at the above website to support their   discussions.<BR>
<BR>
Including ICT across the Curriculum in meaningful ways has   long been an aspiration. Where ICT can contribute in other subjects it enhances   both pupils' ICT skills and the subject itself. As far as the personalisation   agenda is concerned, ICT could be used in other subject areas in two ways,   firstly to support learners with tasks they would find difficult without the   technologies (for example, screen readers for dyslexic students in English).   However, a major aspect of personalisation across the curriculum would be the   application of virtual learning evnvironments. This would be further enhanced by   the ability of pupils to access the VLEs from a variety of mobile devices. They   could access learning materials and support in different places and at different   times both before, during and after traditional face to face teaching   sessions.<BR>
<BR>
The Teaching and Learning Research programme's InterActive   project examined ways in which ICT could be used in primary to post-16   educational settings to enhance learning. It evaluated initiatives in a range of   subjects, as well as cross-curricular learning, such as numeracy literacy and   problem solving. The project reports and website provide further information: <A href="external.html?link=http://www.tlrp.org/proj/phase11/phase2i.html" target="blank">InterActive Education:Teaching and Learning in the Information   Age</A><BR>
<BR>
<strong>2.4 Assessment for learning and ICT</strong><BR>
<BR>
<strong>2.4.1   Assessing with ICT</strong><BR>
Effective use of Assessment for Learning is one of the   key components in the DCSF Personalised Learning guidance. Understanding what   pupils know and can do is the first stage of any teacher&rsquo;s drive to make   learning more personal. The Teaching and Learning Research Programme (TLRP)   report contains several useful case studies that examine the impact of teachers&rsquo;   working towards a more personalised approach. In one case study, which considers   InterActive Education, the TLRP team looked at how advanced technologies can   promote learning in classrooms. Crucially, it looked at how pupil engagement   with ICT lead to a greater understanding of what they knew about subjects such   as mathematics:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em><BR>
  &ldquo;However, we have found that extended individual engagement   can lead students to acquire idiosyncratic knowledge which is at odds with the   intended learning. For example, when a group of primary school students were   investigating the properties of a parallelogram through interacting with   geometry software, they recorded the following:<BR>
  <BR>
  'It has four sides; they   are like train tracks, they are parallel; it doesn&rsquo;t have any right angles; it&rsquo;s   the colour turquoise, it can be a diamond.'<BR>
  <BR>
  All of these statements are   correct, but not all are appropriate within the context of school   mathematics.&rdquo;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Digital technologies offer a range of   tools for assessment, and some schools are now making use of quiz tools on their   VLEs. Discussion boards can also be good ways of gathering pupils&rsquo;   ideas.<BR>
<BR>
In a study of student empowerment, Kelvin Tan asks whether student   self-assessment empowers or disciplines students (Tan, 2004). He concludes that   student empowerment can only be realised if the ways in which we use   self-assessment practices are first understood and it is realised that they do   not necessarily become independent learners if the constraints and expectations   are prescriptive or even mandatory. He explains that, even though student   self-assessment is a popular practice for enhancing student empowerment in the   assessment process, that some writers have even warned that students'   participation in the assessment process may discipline, rather than empower,   them. His paper examines the issues of power that underlie student   self-assessment practices. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>2.4.2 E-portfolios</strong><BR>
The Association   for Learning Technology (Roberts et al, 2005, p5) reports that e-portfolios are   one means by which governments are seeking to build knowledge economies. The   Department for Education and Skills assert that they seek to &ldquo;Provide integrated   e-portfolios [for Schools] by 2007&rdquo; and to provide, &ldquo;A personalised learning   space, with the potential to support e-portfolios available within every college   by 2007-08&rdquo; (DfES, 2005). It has been suggested that the European Commission   should develop a portfolio system as a method for lifelong learners to   demonstrate their formal and informal qualifications and competence. Reasons   given for the interest in these developments include: <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&bull; reducing contact time while also increasing the quality of contact   time<BR>
  &bull; increasing learner autonomy and self-direction<BR>
  &bull; stimulating   reflection and deep learning<BR>
  &bull; helping lifelong learning<BR>
  &bull; facilitating   progression of learners within and between institutions and between national   education systems.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><strong>2.5 Issues for reflection and   consideration</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  This section deals with a number of important areas for   discussion when considering personalisation of learning. Trainee teachers should   consider the relevant parts of the curriculum, as set out in section 2.3.1 and   how they could develop their own personalisation practice in planning and   delivering teaching. <BR>

Personalised learning also means making the   school student-centric. Effective learning must inform classroom layout, school   organisation and the overall ethos (Roberts et al 2005). One aspect of the Every   Child Matters agenda is <em>&ldquo;engaging and helping parents in actively supporting   their children&rsquo;s learning and development&rdquo;</em>. The home-accessible learning   platform is one way in which you can provide access for the parents of your   pupils to your teaching materials and assessments. <em>&ldquo;For secondary schools,   the core offer is similar [including study support, family learning and parental   support opportunities], encouraging schools to open up facilities such as   sports, arts and ICT&rdquo;.</em> (DfES, 2004, p3). <BR>
<BR>
Another area of particular   interest to ICT teacher trainees includes the contribution made by the use of   computer hardware to personalisation. For example, a graphics tablet or remote   keyboard can be given to a pupil to demonstrate to the rest of the class. Pupils   can be involved in talking about and demonstrating their achievements without   the emotional or physical issues of having to go and stand in front of the   class. As their confidence grows they might let a pupil use the mouse and   keyboard to carry out the computer operations as they give their exposition from   the front of the class. This gives some pupils a sense of responsibility and the   trainee greater freedom to concentrate upon their exposition or management of   the class. The general approach meets with the desires of pupil centredness or   personalisation in learning. <BR>
<BR>
Contextualised learning has an influence   upon personalisation of the individual pupil&rsquo;s experience. For example, the new   generation of map software enables you to provide pupils with experience of   exploring their own area with high degrees of fidelity. Representations using   the regular 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 Ordnance Survey notation can now be overlaid   with aerial photographs and historical maps. This gives pupils a sense of their   place in history and a better understanding of the overall environment.   Measuring tools and the facility to change the colour tone, scale and   orientation of maps enables pupils to use the maps in presentations. For   example, they could exemplify environmental factors by labelling a map local to   their school. The personal nature of this contextualised learning adds   motivation for most students.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>3.2 Learning Outside The   Classroom</strong><BR>
<BR>
Personalising learning may also mean that learners engage   with school in non-traditional settings. Learning outside the classroom might   take place in the home, or when travelling or in the community and wider   environment. Mobile digital technologies are well placed to support this, and   the role of the ubiquitous mobile phone is discussed in more detail in section   4. In approaching the topic of learning outside the classroom with   traineeteachers, it might be useful to look at the Futurelab <A href="external.html?link=http://www.futurelab.org.uk/resources/publications-reports-articles/opening-education-reports/Opening-Education-Report201" target="blank">Learners Charter for a personalised learning environment</A>. This   document was produced to encourage debate about what a more personalised   learning environment might look like and using it could help students develop a   wider understanding of what a &lsquo;learning environment (digital and non digital)   might be like. Crucially, the charter sets out the appropriate learning   environments that learners can expect, including:<BR>
<BR>
&bull; Access to different   teaching and learning approaches and resources that meet my needs<BR>
<BR>
&bull;   Access to people who are able to extend and develop my understanding in my   chosen areas<BR>
<BR>
&bull; Access to learning environments and resources that enable   me to develop my understanding and experience in authentic and appropriate   contexts<BR>
<BR>
This meets the Professional Standard Q30; teachers in training   are expected to &ldquo;identify opportunities for learners to learn in out-of-school   contexts&rdquo;.<BR>
<BR>
The <A href="external.html?link=http://www.lotc.org.uk/" target="blank">Learning Outside the Classroom</A> website offers information,   guidance and resources.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>3.3 Issues for reflection</strong><BR>
<BR>
Trainee   teachers should consider to what extent their own practice currently allows for   a personalised learning experience. It might be useful to analyse practice at   the level of the lesson plan as well as teaching strategies   employed.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<strong>4.1 Existing   and Future Technologies and Personalisation </strong><BR>
<BR>
Many of the ICT tools   and applications that would support teachers in offering more personalised   learning opportunities already exist. However at the time of writing, they are   not substantially embedded in the pedagogical approaches of most schools. A   report into digital technologies and personalisation is published by Futurelab.   The paper can be useful to tutors in ITE to introduce the issues and encourage   debate amongst students about how digital technologies might support more   personalised learning. The aims for the paper are set out in the   introduction:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em>"This paper aims to contribute to this debate by articulating a   range of ways in<BR>
  which we might move forward in achieving these goals,   specifically by<BR>
  harnessing the potential of digital technologies in four key   areas central to the<BR>
  goals of personalisation: enabling learners to make   informed educational<BR>
  choices; diversifying and acknowledging different forms   of skills and knowledge; the creation of diverse learning environments; and the   development of learner-focused forms of assessment and feedback.   "</em><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The paper can be downloaded at the Futurelab website - <A href="external.html?link=http://www.futurelab.org.uk/resources/documents/opening_education/Personalisation_report.pdf" target="blank">digital technologies</A><BR>
<BR>
Trainee teachers should also look   at how specific technologies can impact on personalisation and the contribution   of mobile technologies and virtual learning environments (VLEs) can make to   this. To find about more about these technologies themselves these links may be   useful. <BR>
<BR>
Some discussion of the contribution mobile devices can make is   available on the Futurelab website - <A href="external.html?link=http://www.futurelab.org.uk/resources/publications-reports-articles/web-articles/Web-Article1125" target="blank">mobile</A><BR>
<BR>
A more general overview of VLEs technologies is   available on this website:<BR>

<A href="text_onlyf14f.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=2&ts=4">Primary   Issues - VLEs</A><BR>
<BR>
<strong>4.2 Mobile Technologies and   Personalisation</strong><BR>
<BR>
Mobile technologies include phones, personal data   assistants (PDAs) and laptop computers all of which can be used to create   information (in text or pictures), retrieve information (through a connection to   the internet) or communicate (via email, text or web based social networking).   Increasingly these are devices to which children and young people have access.   However, it should not be assumed that all children have and can use such   devices (as the media stereotype might assert) and teachers should be aware of   the &lsquo;digital divide&rsquo;, which means that for some pupils socio-economic or   learning issues might mean that they do not have access to mobile technologies. <BR>
<BR>
<A href="text_onlyc1b7.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=10&ts=4">ICT   in Teaching - Portable Devices</A><BR>
<A href="text_onlydbcd.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=2&ts=1">Primary   Issues - downloadable article on Mobile Technologies</A><BR>
<BR>
The Futurelab   and University of Nottingham project <A href="external.html?link=http://www.futurelab.org.uk/projects/mobimissions" target="blank">mobimissions</A> provides an interesting case study of how mobile   devices could support personalised learning. In the project, learners used the   mobile phones to create, access and respond to tasks based in particular places.   Learners then rated the missions and each others' responses to them. The project   explored the link between learners and places, and had many other learning   outcomes, including encouraging collaborative and peer learning and peer   assessment of learning. While this project is specific in its purpose and scope,   the technologies used and learning outcomes for the participants could be used   in other learning contexts, and would be particularly useful in engaging   reluctant learners because of its non-school based and collaborative   approach.<BR>
<BR>
Another research project, this time carried out by BECTA,   looked into the relationship between <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh&catcode=_re_rp_02&rid=15482" target="blank">secondary schools and mobile phones</A>. This study found that in   the majority of schools, mobile phone use was actively discouraged. It goes on   to explore how and why mobile phones might be of use in learning. The study   identifies 15 useful things pupils can do with mobile phones:<BR>
<BR>
1 Timing   experiments with stopwatch<BR>
2 Photographing apparatus and results of   experiments for reports<BR>
3 Photographing the development of design models for   eportfolios<BR>
4 Photographing texts/whiteboards for future review<BR>
5   Bluetoothing project material between group members<BR>
6 Receiving SMS &amp;   email reminders from teachers<BR>
7 Synchronising calendar/timetable and setting   reminders<BR>
8 Connecting remotely to the school learning platform<BR>
9   Recording a teacher reading a poem for revision<BR>
10 Accessing revision sites   on the Internet<BR>
11 Creating short narrative movies <BR>
12 Downloading and   listening to foreign language podcasts<BR>
13 Logging into the school email   system <BR>
14 Using GPS to identify locations<BR>
15 Transferring files between   school and home<BR>
<BR>
In all of these, mobile phones can help pupils learn in   ways that support their individual needs and provide a more personalised   learning experience by enabling them to effectively communicate with other   pupils and their teachers and make stronger links between school and out of   school learning. Trainee teachers should consider how such applications could be   used to help meet the learning needs of pupils in the schools in which they are   placed, although they should be aware that they must, during their training   period, adhere to school policies on mobile phones in the   classroom.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>4.3 Personalised Virtual Learning   Environments</strong><BR>
<BR>
Most schools now have access to Virtual Learning   Environments (or learning platforms as they are sometimes known), and some have   begun to make use of them in various ways, including communication, access to   additional and supplementary learning resources and e-assessment. Virtual   Learning Environments are used to support face to face teaching in a number of   ways, which can be divided into three levels:<BR>
<BR>
&bull; Level 1. The online   filing cabinet. At this level, teachers can use the VLE to post files for   learners to access and use the notice-board functionality for   communications.<BR>
<BR>
&bull; Level 2. The online meeting room. At this level,   teachers use the VLE to post files and announcements and make some use of the   other communications tools such as email and chat facilities. At this level the   wider use of communication tools supports the learners in using the teaching   materials and aligning the use of the VLE with their face to face teaching   sessions.<BR>
<BR>
&bull; Level 3. The online classroom. The teacher makes use of a   wide range of communication tools and groups learners to target communications   as well as using the assessment tools and monitoring software to assess the   impact of the teaching that is taking place via the VLE.<BR>
<BR>
Where the VLE is   being used in schools at level 2 or 3, the VLE can support the personalisation   of learning. In addition, if the VLE use is planned into teaching schemes at an   early stage, its use can support personalisation in face to face teaching too,   by supporting learners who need to prepare for sessions, and those that need   help afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
The impact of VLEs in schools is yet to be fully   researched. A BECTA <A href="external.html?link=http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh&catcode=_re_rp_02_a&rid=13640" target="blank">literature review</A> published in 2003 found that while   increasingly extensive use was being made of VLEs in Higher Education, there was   little research evidence to suggest it was being used in schools. However, over   the next few years this should change, with a requirement that all schools   should be using a &lsquo;comprehensive suite of learning platform technologies&rsquo; by   2010.<BR>
<BR>
Link to BECTA advice on <A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=oe&catcode=ss_es_opp_02&rid=12887" target="blank">VLE</A><BR>
<BR>
Over the next few years there is likely to be some   significant work in schools to build in the use of VLEs. This should enable   schools and teachers to offer an increasingly personalised learning experience   to pupils. Teachers of ICT and ICT specialists in schools have an important role   to play in this process.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>4.4 Issues for reflection and   consideration</strong><BR>
<BR>
Trainee teachers should consider their own reflections   on the practical implications of the personalisation agenda. <BR>
<BR>
The   following diagram, which represents the thinking of a group of 14 ICT teacher   trainees after the first 3 months of their training (6 weeks in school) may be a   useful starting point. The areas that they did not reflect fully upon include   the school structures (timetable, break times, tutorial support, before/after   school arrangements) and a more comprehensive listing of classroom   strategies.<BR>
