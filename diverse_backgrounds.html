<H1>The range of diversity and the national context</H1>
<BR>
<strong>Range of   diversity</strong><BR>
Within the education system, there has been an increase in   overall levels of educational attainment. However, the following factors still   affect the relative attainment and achievement of individual pupils and groups   of pupils.
<UL>
  <LI>Social class   
  <LI>Race and ethnicity  
  <LI>Religious diversity  
  <LI>Multilingual learners  
  <LI>Refugees and asylum seekers  
  <LI>Travellers and Roma</LI>
</UL>
A broader list of minority groups requiring   sensitivity and consideration include: BME communities (black and minority   ethnic), older people, disabled people, rough sleepers, migrant workers,   offenders and ex-offenders and members of LGBT communities (lesbian, gay,   bisexual and transgender). <BR>
<BR>
The needs of these students often mirrors   those of pupils with special educational needs. It may need to be recognised   that pupils with diverse backgrounds may also have special educational needs of   a temporary or long term kind. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>The National Context</strong><BR>
<BR>
In   meeting the Professional Standards for Teachers (TDA, 2007) for achievement and   diversity trainees must ensure they:<BR>
<BR>
Q18 Understand how children and   young people develop and that the progress and well-being of learners are   affected by a range of developmental, social, religious, ethnic, cultural and   linguistic influences.<BR>
<BR>
Q19 Know how to make effective personalised   provision for those they teach, including those for whom English is an   additional language (EAL) or who have special educational needs or disabilities,   and how to take practical account of diversity and promote equality and   inclusion in their teaching.<BR>
<BR>
Q20 Know and understand the roles of   colleagues with specific responsibilities, including those with responsibility   for learners with special educational needs and disabilities and other   individual learning needs.<BR>
<BR>
Both internationally and within the UK there   is support for the development of inclusive schooling. <BR>
<BR>
The notion that   &lsquo;Every Child Matters&rsquo; (see <A href="external.html?link=http://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/" target="blank">http://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk</A>) underpins the philosophy   of <strong>inclusion</strong>, which drives government thinking on educational provision.   Such developments are linked to concerns about social exclusion and social   justice within education systems specifically and in society at large.<BR>
<BR>
In   addition, specific initiatives such as the &lsquo;Aiming High&rsquo; national strategy (see <A href="external.html?link=http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/ethnicminorities" target="blank">www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/ethnicminorities</A>) put minority   achievement at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s improvement agenda by establishing:
<UL>
  <LI>a scheme set up to specifically raise standards for black pupils &ndash; one of   the lowest performing groups in the country  
  <LI>greater transparency and accountability, including a more rigorous   inspection framework and publication of achievement data by ethnic group and LEA  
  <LI>support for bilingual pupils which includes support for primary schools and   teachers through the national primary strategy to help them better support   bilingual pupils, a national qualification for EAL specialists and a nationally   recognised method of assessment to monitor bilingual pupils progress from   foundation stage to secondary school</LI>
</UL>
<p>The TDA supported Multiverse site   (see <A href="external.html?link=http://www.multiverse.ac.uk/" target="blank">http://www.multiverse.ac.uk</A>) provides teacher educators and   student teachers/trainees with resources that focus on the educational   achievement of pupils from diverse backgrounds. Those resources include a   glossary of terms, news items, direct references to the standards for teacher   training, events and conferences for tutors and trainees and web links to other   resources.<BR>

<H1>Inclusion<BR>
  and the inclusive curriculum</H1>
<BR>
All schools are charged   with providing an inclusive curriculum which meets the needs of all pupils. This   is a statutory requirement and a key focus for inspection of   schools.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>What does it mean?</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Inclusion in education is one aspect of inclusion in society  
  <LI>Inclusion is about improving the education system for everybody, regardless   of disabilities or background  
  <LI>It is a process of breaking down barriers to learning and participation for   all children and young people   
  <LI>It should ensure that no group or individual is excluded or left behind. </LI>
</UL>
<strong>How do we achieve it? </strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Creating inclusive cultures  
  <LI>Producing inclusive policies  
  <LI>Evolving inclusive practices</LI>
</UL>
<strong>Create an <em>inclusive   culture</em></strong>
<UL>
  <LI>A secure, accepting, collaborating, stimulating community in which everybody   is valued  
  <LI>Build a community of collaboration  
  <LI>Establish inclusive values, with high expectations of all regardless of   ability </LI>
</UL>
<strong>Produce <em>inclusive policies</em></strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Make sure inclusion permeates all of the institution&rsquo;s policies  
  <LI>Develop the &lsquo;Institution for all&rsquo; where everybody is valued  
  <LI>Organise support for diversity and challenge to ensure learning   opportunities are matched to the particular needs of students  
  <LI>Develop procedures for education and rehabilitation to reduce pressures for   drop out and/or exclusion</LI>
</UL>
<strong>Implement <em>inclusive practices</em> to   help trainees and teachers to be inclusive</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>Acceptance of value of all students regardless of background  
  <LI>Availability of sufficient and suitable teaching support  
  <LI>Awareness amongst all staff of the particular needs of students and   understanding of practical ways of meeting them in classrooms and elsewhere  
  <LI>A curriculum for all, with sensible allocation to teaching groups and   careful modification of the curriculum, timetables and social arrangements  
  <LI>Availability of appropriate materials and teaching aids  
  <LI>Classroom and extracurricular activities that encourage all students to take   part and lessons which are responsive to student diversity  
  <LI>Assessment, recording and reporting procedures which can identify the   progress of students who make only small gains in learning and personal   development  
  <LI>Involving parents in decision making, keeping them informed about their   child&rsquo;s progress and giving them support  
  <LI>Developing and using training opportunities which support understanding of   these issues  
  <LI>Distribute resources fairly</LI>
</UL>
<p><BR>
  <strong>Trainee activity:</strong> in a group   of 3 or 4 go through the checklist above identifying or suggesting examples and   opportunities within the ICT classroom, curriculum or teaching.<BR>

<H1>Research and current developments<BR>
  in diversity awareness</H1>
<BR>
The   inclusion website (see <A href="external.html?link=http://inclusion.ngfl.gov.uk/" target="blank">http://inclusion.ngfl.gov.uk</A>) offers a search facility linking   to a range of referenced resources aimed at individual educational needs and an   &ldquo;ask an expert&rdquo; support facility.<BR>
<BR>
Recent research and government reports   suggest that raising achievement amongst students from diverse backgrounds is   most successful in schools that create an inclusive community. (See <A href="text_only13a6.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=12&ts=7">Resources   to support diversity awareness</A> in this section.)<BR>
<BR>
A <A href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/upload/resources/pdf/n/nqt%20survey%202006%20-%20sector%20level%20report.pdf" target="blank">TDA survey</A> of newly qualified teachers in 2006 showed that only   36% thought themselves well prepared to teach children from minority ethnic   backgrounds and only 32% in relation to children with English as an additional   language. The 2008 report shows a positive trend in teacher awareness but   diversity awareness scores lower than other comparable items in the   questionnaire. <A href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/upload/resources/pdf/n/nqt_survey_results_2008.pdf" target="blank">2008 Survey</A><BR>
<BR>
Trainee teachers need help to appreciate the   effects the diverse backgrounds of students have on learning so that they can   develop better strategies that are more inclusive. <BR>
<BR>
In England, 10% of   pupils are learning English as an additional language.<BR>
<BR>
In the classroom,   ITT students need to develop an understanding of the following:
<UL>
  <LI>The learning needs of students from diverse backgrounds   
  <LI>How their learning needs may be recognised and met  
  <LI>The teacher skills and knowledge they need in order to raise the achievement   of these pupils  
  <LI>The teaching, learning and assessment strategies that are likely to be most   effective  
  <LI>How to adapt teaching and differentiation strategies to take account of the   evolving learning needs of students  
  <LI>The potential barriers to achievement they need to consider and   overcome</LI>
</UL>
<p><BR>
  The Multiverse website continues to be a most useful   resource for all aspects of diversity and inclusion areas of education. The   research page continues (2009) to be current and developing.<BR>

<H1>The TDA supporting good practice<BR>
  for diversity awareness</H1>
<BR>
The TDA   has developed an on line ITT professional research network (IPRN) designed to   help teacher trainers equip trainees with the skills needed to maximise the   achievement of pupils from diverse backgrounds. The Multiverse website provides   a professional knowledge base with exemplars of effective practice from around   the world and a breadth of high quality ITT resources. In addition, it provides   opportunities for the interchange of ideas and collaboration between ITT   providers, through contributions to research and participation in conferences   and seminars.<BR>
<BR>
The Multiverse website (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.multiverse.ac.uk/" target="blank">www.multiverse.ac.uk</A>) contains the following resources:
<UL>
  <LI>Academic papers

<UL>
  <LI>Race and ethnicity  
  <LI>Social class  
  <LI>Religious diversity  
  <LI>Bilingual and multilingual learners  
  <LI>Refugees and asylum seekers  
  <LI>Travellers and Roma</LI>
</UL>
Within each strand tutors can view current   issues arranged under themes:

  <strong>Inclusion for those whose first language is not   English</strong>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
The National Association for Language Development in   the Curriculum (NALDIC) website (see <A href="external.html?link=http://www.naldic.org.uk/" target="blank">http://www.naldic.org.uk</A>) provides excellent information   relating to the teaching of pupils for whom English is an additional Language. <BR>
<BR>
For the guidance of the classroom teacher, NALDIC suggest that in   addressing the needs of pupils, particularly those with English as an additional   language, teachers should:
<UL>
  <LI>Activate prior knowledge. Within ICT students may have practical experience   of using the computer and so knowledge and skills may be transferable to the new   context for learning they now face.  
  <LI>Promote language learning alongside academic content learning, drawing on   pupils&rsquo; bicultural and bilingual experience and incorporating first language   knowledge where appropriate to the benefit of learning.  
  <LI>Provide a rich contextual background to make input comprehensible. The   potential for work to be presented visually and language free may greatly   improve content learning for EAL learners. Graphic and visual display support   the development of conceptual and language knowledge. ICT also provides   opportunities for pupils to engage in active learning experiences.  
  <LI>Encourage comprehensible output. Teachers need to encourage learners to   produce spoken and written language, promoting greater consciousness of language   use and identifying those aspects of language in need of additional support.  
  <LI>Develop learner independence through the selection of planned activities   that encourage students to become self-reliant. Opportunities within an ICT   lesson are many.  
  <LI>Be able to assess pupils&rsquo; understanding of curriculum content, comprehend   issues relating to progression in second/additional language, and use this   knowledge to inform lesson planning.</LI>
</UL>
Some practical ideas for the ICT   classroom
<UL>
  <LI>Use computer software that uses text, voice and pictures to help pupils   learn concepts  
  <LI>Use voice output systems to enable pupils to check their own text  
  <LI>Use e-mail or video conferencing to increase social contact and enable   pupils to participate with others from similar backgrounds  
  <LI>Use computer software to assess pupils ICT strengths and   weaknesses</LI>
</UL>
<p>A section of the NALDIC site, ITTSEAL, focuses specifically   on ITT issues and contains a host of useful information (see <A href="external.html?link=http://www.naldic.org.uk/ITTSEAL/ittseal_reg.cfm" target="blank">http://www.naldic.org.uk/ITTSEAL/ittseal_reg.cfm</A>).<BR>
  Guidance   on ICT and EAL learners is gradually emerging through conferences, papers, case   studies etc. The current position can be explored at: <A href="external.html?link=http://www.naldic.org.uk/docs/resources/ICT.cfm" target="blank">http://www.naldic.org.uk/docs/resources/ICT.cfm</A> and NALDIC&rsquo;s   statement on ICT and EAL teaching and learning is available at:<BR>

<em>Tackling Black and Minority Ethnic   Underachievement</em> by Carol Adams and Shiraz Chakera for the General Teaching   Council for England, published in 2004. Black and minority ethnic   underachievement in our schools came into sharper focus as a result of the   amended Race Relations Act 2000. It places quite specific duties on schools to   monitor, evaluate and act on data covering most areas of school policies and   practices to tackle racial inequality. In the education sector there is evidence   that particular groups of black and minority ethnic pupils are achieving   significantly lower academic results than their white peers. This paper   concludes that the Race Relations Act can help challenge the inequalities   between some ethnic groups through giving informed teachers the opportunity to   challenge underachievement in all its complexities. &ldquo;Teachers are able to   address underachievement that stems from socio-economic disadvantage, or from   prejudiced attitudes towards another&rsquo;s ethnicity, gender or disability (and   underachievement that arises from the interaction between these factors).&rdquo;   Accessed through the GTC <A href="external.html?link=http://www.gtce.org.uk/documents/publicationpdfs/policy_0904_bme.pdf" target="blank">http://www.gtce.org.uk/documents/publicationpdfs/policy_0904_bme.pdf</A> <BR>

<BR>
The 2003   OFSTED report <em>The Education of Asylum-Seeker Pupils</em> describes the quality   of teaching and of support for the great majority of the asylum-seeker pupils as   at least satisfactory and often good. The teaching was at its most effective   where there were close collaboration, planning and support between class   teachers and staff responsible for diversity/inclusion education. Many   asylum-seeker pupils made good progress in relatively short periods and almost   all made at least satisfactory progress. The combination of their determination   to succeed and the strong support of their parents provided a potent recipe for   success. The report is available online from <A href="external.html?link=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Publications-and-research/Browse-all-by/Education/Inclusion/Asylum-seeker-children/The-education-of-asylum-seeker-pupils" target="blank">http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/publications</A> <em>The Education of   Asylum-Seeker Pupils,</em>, HMI 453 (2003), Ofsted .<BR>

The book <em>Inclusive Education: Learners and Learning Contexts</em> is an edited   collection of papers by academics and professionals engaged with a diversity of   learners and learning contexts within the sphere of inclusive education. It   explores questions such as how to respond to children at risk of exclusion and   what we can learn from each other in enhancing inclusion. It includes an   examination of issues of gender, ethnicity, class, culture, sexuality and   disability and an examination of inclusive practice in different schools and   different classrooms.
