<H2>Framework for the 14-19 curriculum<br>Introduction</H2>
<p><br>
  This resource looks at the developments of the 14-19 curriculum in England and how they impact on the work of ICT teachers and teacher trainers. It considers the underlying aims of the government led changes and the subsequent implications. <br><br>The reforms see a breakdown of the traditional break at the age of 16 between school and school/college/training/employment/unemployment future for pupils. There is a change in the location of learning from age 14 years with many pupils spending regular or block placements of time out-of-school. There is a change in the staffing with college and work-based staff working alongside teachers in the classroom. There are implications for the curriculum with courses and qualifications being awarded for learning that spans the whole age range. <br><br>In the accompanying pages, the important aspects of the Diploma in IT and functional skills are described. There is a comprehensive list of references and resources. Explanations for the abbreviations and terms can be found in the <a href="text_only27d3.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=8&tp=0&ts=1">Glossary</a> section on this site.<br><br>These implications of the reforms are discussed in the following sections: <br><br>

<H1>Aims</H1>
<BR>
<strong>Aims of the 14-19 Curriculum reforms</strong><BR>
<BR>
The   Government Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) is committed to   transforming the 14-19 curriculum over the coming decade with a strategy   involving:
<UL>
  <LI>curriculum  
  <LI>assessment  
  <LI>provision   
  <LI>resourcing. </LI>
</UL>
This will be done through fostering partnerships   between a range of agencies including:
<UL>
  <LI>local authorities  
  <LI>the Learning and Skills Council  
  <LI>schools  
  <LI>colleges   
  <LI>work-based learning providers. </LI>
</UL>
Reform of the previous system was   needed because pupils could easily choose options that ultimately became   dead-ends which offered little in the way of further progression or opportunity   and which did not encourage participation in education beyond 16. <BR>
<BR>
The   14-19 Working Group, headed by Mike Tomlinson, set out proposals for a long-term   structural reform of 14-19 education and training systems that will be fully   inclusive, encouraging all learners <em>"whatever their ability"</em> to achieve   their full potential. <BR>
<BR>
The proportion of 16-17 year olds not in   employment, education or training (NEET) has steadily increased over the last   couple of years. <em>"Being NEET is a major predictor of later unemployment, low   incomes, teenage motherhood, depression and poor physical health."</em> (DfES,   2005b)<BR>
<BR>
In summary, the 14-19 agenda developed by the Government's reports   is based around:
<UL>
  <LI>a new specialist system  
  <LI>built on collaboration  
  <LI>a strong focus on teaching and personalised learning  
  <LI>excellent leadership teams  
  <LI>reform of the school workforce  
  <LI>heavy investment in ICT and school buildings through the Building Schools   for the Future programme (DfES, 2004). </LI>
</UL>
<BR>
The reforms have three main   elements (DfES, 2007a):
<UL>
  <LI>raising attainment now  
  <LI>designing new curriculum and qualifications  
  <LI>delivering on the ground.</LI>

<H1>Location of learning</H1>
<BR>
<strong>Changing the location of learning under the   14-19 reforms</strong><BR>
<BR>
The 14-19 reforms were designed to give all young   people the opportunity to choose a mix of learning which motivates, interests   and challenges them, and which gives them the knowledge, skills and attitudes   they need to succeed in education, work, and life. They see the breakdown of the   traditional route of many young people who stay at school until 16 and then go   onto work, training or college. As a result of these reforms some students start   regular attendance at college or work placements at 14 whilst others continue in   schooling to 18 but with weekly or block placements in commercial and/or further   education settings.<BR>

<H1>Teaching and learning</H1>
<p><BR>
  <strong>Changing the nature of teaching and   learning under the 14-19 reforms<BR>
<BR>
Andragogy, pedagogy and   beyond...</strong><BR>
<BR>
School-based learning, the work of teachers and the   development of trainees are driven by the understanding and implementation of   pedagogy. In teacher training, it is described as subject knowledge and   understanding. The work of Shulman focuses upon pedagogic content knowledge -   not just a teacher's knowledge of the curriculum but the teacher's knowledge of   how to teach the skills, knowledge, concepts and attitudes of the   subject.<BR>
<BR>
Tutors and trainers in further education are driven by   andragogy. It is their perception of how adults learn and constructing the right   environment for learning. If differences exist then teachers, tutors, trainers   and trainees working in the 14-19 context need to understand the differences and   similarities.<BR>
<BR>
The following texts describe the nature of the current   pedagogy (teaching in schools), andragogy (teaching adults) and then goes on to   describe heutagogy - the principle of teaching based upon the concept of truly   self-determined learning. <BR>
<BR>
It is suggested that heutagogy is appropriate   to the needs of learners in the twenty-first century, particularly in the   development of individual capability, individualised learning and independent   learning using the internet-based systems including multimedia, virtual learning   environments, online assessments and social software.<BR>

<H1>Accreditation</H1>
<BR>
<strong>Changing the accreditation of learning under the   14-19 reforms</strong><BR>
<BR>
The aims of the 14-19 agenda are to make reforms in   three main areas:
<UL>
  <LI>raising attainment now;  
  <LI>designing new curriculum and qualifications; and  
  <LI>delivering on the ground.</LI>
</UL>
This section outlines the provision and   developments to ensure that appropriate curriculum and qualifications are in   place to meet the key stage 4 National Curriculum requirements, ensure the   success of the 14-19 provision, and for it to be 'the best anywhere' (DfES,   2007a).<BR>
<BR>
The document below has the following headings:
<UL>
  <LI>The National Qualifications Framework   
  <LI>Section 96 and the national database of accredited qualifications   
  <LI>The range of qualifications available to schools   
  <LI>Basic skills courses   
  <LI>Vendor qualifications   
  <LI>National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs)</LI>
</UL>

<H1>Curriculum</H1>
<BR>
<strong>Changing the curriculum under the 14-19   reforms</strong><BR>
<BR>
The Tomlinson report recommended that GCSEs, A levels and   vocational qualifications should evolve over the next decade into a new open   diploma system enabling learners to select a mixed pattern of subjects and areas   of learning similar to those available through GCE, GCSE and vocational   qualifications.<BR>
<BR>
One of the outcomes of his report is the creation of a   Specialised Diploma specification. It will provide a clear indication to   employers, universities and others as to the range of skills, knowledge and   experience of young people. <BR>
<BR>
The Apprenticeships (<A href="text_onlyd245.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=5&ts=3">see   Location of learning</A>) would be linked to the diploma system through clear   progression routes so that students can more freely integrate academic and   vocational study.<BR>
<BR>
The document below contains descriptions of:
<UL>
  <LI>Specialised Diploma in IT   
  <LI>The diploma gateway   
  <LI>Functional Skills - the new key skills.</LI>

The   document below contains all the references cited in these 14-19   pages.<BR>
<BR>
With many routes to QTS having associated Masters level (NQF level   5) accreditation associated with them, it is important that trainees can cite   and then reference resources, authoritative documents, reports of research and   academic work in an appropriate and consistent format. <BR>
