<H2>ICT in Primary ITT</H2>
<br>The initial resources on this website focused on new tutors who were involved in teaching secondary trainees. All of those resources thave been updated and, where appropriate, also include guidance and information of relevance to new tutors involved in teaching primary trainees. Nevertheless, we feel that the role of primary tutors is sufficiently different from that of secondary tutors to warrant this specific set of resources that focus on their needs.  The <a href="text_only6e5e.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=3&tp=5&ts=1">Primary Support</a> article by Richard Bennett provides a guide to other resources on this website that are appropriate for those tutoring in the primary sector.<br><br>The resource includes guidance on three current issues, namely:<br><blockquote><a href="text_only6391.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=2&ts=2">Every Child Matters</a><br><a href="text_only558c.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=2&ts=3">Building Schools for the Future</a><br><a href="text_onlyf14f.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=2&ts=4">Virtual Learning Environments</a><br></blockquote>Trainee teachers should be aware of these initiatives and tutors may decide to focus one or two teaching sessions on each topic. However, the topics can be a little sterile if tutors describe these initiatives to the students without trying to involve the students in the session(s). Hence the resources on this site briefly describe the mainstay of the initiative and then suggest one or two teaching activities by which students can become active participants in the session. The article on Building Schools for the Future also includes reference to the ICT Mark but this initiative (a kite mark for schools) is well documented on both the <a href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=srf&amp;catcode=ss_to_srf_suc_icm_03" target="blank">Becta</a> and <a href="external.html?link=http://www.naace.org/ictmark" target="blank">Naace</a> sites.<br><br>There are a further <B>four articles</B> on more specific ICT matters:<br><blockquote><BULLET><B>WEB 2.0 technologies</B><br>One of the difficulties of tutoring in the primary sector is the requirement to be familiar with all aspects of the National Curriculum and to keep up to date with developments.

<H1>Every Child Matters</H1>
<BR>
The government document, <em>Every Child Matters:   Change for Children</em> (2004), relates to England only, although some sections   of the 2004 Children&rsquo;s Act have relevance for Wales.<BR>
<BR>
The initiative is a   positive outcome of the tragic death of Victoria Climbi&eacute; in February 2000. The   death of this child caused a major change in the way children&rsquo;s services are   organised. The hope is that they should become more coordinated and integrated   to safeguard and support every child. The <em>Laming Report</em> provides a   detailed summary of the implications of this approachfor all those working with   the young. These issues have taken on renewed urgency in the wake of the Baby P   incident (August 2007). <A href="external.html?link=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7732193.stm" target="blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7732193.stm</A><BR>

<strong>Aims and outcomes</strong><BR>
<BR>
<em>Every   Child Matters: Change for Children</em> is a new approach to the well-being of   children and young people from birth to age 19. The Government's aim is for   every child, whatever their background or their circumstances, to have the   support they need to:
<UL>
  <LI>Be healthy  
  <LI>Stay safe  
  <LI>Enjoy and achieve  
  <LI>Make a positive contribution  
  <LI>Achieve economic well-being</LI>
</UL>
These are frequently referred to as the   'five outcomes' and have proved to be highly influential in shaping school-based   policy and practice.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>The Report &ndash; more background   information</strong><BR>
<BR>
Below is a more detailed account of the document and its   general relevance to children and to education.<BR>
<BR>
As already mentioned   there are five key outcomes in the document. There is a detailed list of 25   specific aims for children and young people and the support from others (such as   parents and carers) to achieve these aims.<BR>
<BR>
For example the first outcome   has these sub-headings-<BR>
<BR>
Be healthy <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em>Physically healthy<BR>
  Mentally and emotionally   healthy<BR>
  Sexually healthy<BR>
  Healthy lifestyles<BR>
  Choose not to take illegal   drugs<BR>
  Parents, carers and families promote healthy   choices</em></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
All the other sections have similar points under the   headings.<BR>
<BR>
In essence departments that have anything to do with children   should have integrated all departments that provide care of children with need   to coordinate their approach to and care of children. Such organisations as   hospitals, police, schools and youth services will need to share information and   work together to provide a better way for children to be safe and achieve a good   quality of life. The emphasis has moved away from just protecting children to   one where prevention at the level of the community is seen as   paramount.<BR>
<BR>
Taken from the document <em>Every Child Matters: Change for   Children</em>:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em><strong>1.2</strong> &lsquo;Every child matters&rsquo; and &lsquo;Every child matters: next   steps&rsquo; recognised that the realisation of this ambition for improved outcomes   required radical change in the whole system of children&rsquo;s services, including:
  <UL>
    <LI>the improvement and integration of universal services &ndash; in early years   settings, schools and the health service;  
    <LI>more specialised help to promote opportunity, prevent problems and act early   and effectively if and when problems arise;  
    <LI>the reconfiguration of services around the child and family in one place,   for example, children&rsquo;s centres, extended schools and the bringing together of   professionals in multi-disciplinary teams;  
    <LI>dedicated and enterprising leadership at all levels of the system;  
    <LI>the development of a shared sense of responsibility across agencies for   safeguarding children and protecting them from harm; and  
    <LI>listening to children, young people and their families when assessing and   planning service provision, as well as in face-to-face   delivery.</LI>
  </UL>

<strong>Children&rsquo;s Commissioner</strong><BR>
<BR>
This person was to be the main   lead for the views and interests of children and young people. In March 2005 the   Government appointed Professor Al Aynsley-Green as the first commissioner. This   post was created as a result of <em>Every Child Matters</em>. The <A href="external.html?link=http://www.11million.org.uk/" target="blank">11million</A> website was set up by the commisioner to enable   children to say what they think about issues that affect them.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Why it   is important for schools</strong>
<UL>
  <LI>The Children&rsquo;s Act 2004 put onto the statue books the recommendations of <em>Every Child Matters</em>. The Education departments of Local Authorities were   replaced by Children&rsquo;s Services Authorities who have a lead member for children.   There has to be a Director of Children&rsquo;s Services, who is responsible for   education and the other linked children&rsquo;s services.  
  <LI>Because of the amount of contact time children have with schools they are   seen as central to the integration of all services.  
  <LI>Schools have always had a role in making children safe and healthy (the   first two aims of <em>Every Child Matters</em>). However, education is not just   about teaching and learning. &ldquo;Enjoy and achieve&rdquo;, the third outcome of <em>Every   Child Matters</em>, is now seen as an important focus of established education.   To achieve these aims educators are expected to work closely with the local   health service, social services and other local agencies so that every child   gets the best from life.  
  <LI>Under new school inspection arrangements (Sept 2006) every school will be   inspected against the five areas listed above. Indeed each local authority is   also inspected every year against the same five outcomes.  
  <LI>The government wants schools to extend a whole range of services, activities   and times that the whole community can use the schools.   
  <LI>This is a big sea change in the way schools have previously operated and   presents many challenges for teachers, social workers, health workers and all   the other professionals involved in dealing with children. It is hoped that it   will prevent tragedies like Victoria Climbi&eacute; happening again.</LI>
</UL>
<strong><A href="external.html?link=http://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/deliveringservices/contactpoint/" target="blank">ContactPoint</A></strong><BR>
<BR>
In January 2009 the government started   progress to the first stage of setting up a mechanism for tracking children   using an online directory. Access will be limited to authorised staff to help   deliver coordinated support for children and young people. One aspect of this   should be to stop children disappearing if they move from one part of the   country to another.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Significance to ICT</strong><BR>
<BR>
ICT has   significance to most things in modern life. It is not surprising that it has a   role to play in the implementation of <em>Every Child Matters</em>. Listed below   is a summary of key roles ICT can play in achieving the five   outcomes.<BR>
<BR>
Access to information has been greatly increased by the advent   of Broadband access to the Internet. This should enable children and those with   a role to play in ensuring their well-being to realise the five outcomes of <em>Every Child Matters</em>. <BR>
<BR>
ICT also provides the opportunity for   children to communicate with others and to share information. Through blogs,   podcasts, Wikis, VLEs, personal web space and forums, etc., children can access   the views of others and play a role in society. All this remains positive as   long as e-safety is also taught and implemented. The whole child is also   developed by being made aware of the need for a special sort of etiquette,   netiquette, when using these online tools. (See notes in 'Stay Safe'   below)<BR>
<BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/ete/extendedschools/" target="blank">Extended schools</A> may include facilitating access to ICT for the   community and provided a wider range of activities, some of which may include   ICT. <BR>
<BR>
The <A href="external.html?link=http://www.cwdcouncil.org.uk/projects/integratedqualificationsframework.htm" target="blank">Integrated Qualifications Framework (IQF)</A> aims to make the   qualifications in the children&rsquo;s sector more fit for purpose, and make moving   from one sector to another easier. <BR>
<BR>
The <A href="external.html?link=http://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/deliveringservices/caf/" target="blank">Common Assessment Framework</A> is a standardised means of   assessing the needs of children and young people. <BR>
<BR>
The significance of   Every Child Matters to ICT is further expanded on in the excellent Naace report   listed in the URLs below.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Some practical considerations in the   teaching of ICT</strong><BR>
<BR>
The five outcomes of the Every Child Matters document   all have a bearing on the teaching of ICT. Some considerations and ways of   achieving these outcomes are listed below.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Be healthy</em><BR>

<em>Stay Safe </em><BR>
The positive application   for finding information and communication using ICT has a possible drawback in   that everybody concerned needs to be aware of the dangers of the internet and   other means of e-communication. E-safety needs to be built into education about   the use of ICT.<BR>
<BR>
Recent reviews show the need for awareness &ndash; The Byron   Review, March 2008:<BR>

<BR>
The advent   of broadband connections and the expansion of the Internet means that there is   easier access to information and resources. If this is not available in the   home, then schools and libraries have greatly increased access for   pupils.<BR>
<BR>
EAL &ndash; use of word banks, computer fonts for their first language <BR>
<BR>
Provision for different styles of learning &ndash; e.g. visual and   kinaesthetic learners using drag and drop activities on IWB.<BR>
<BR>
Gifted and   Talented children &ndash; provision of extension activities, use of web quests,   setting a problem of the week, allowing for different types of presentation of   their work (ppt etc.)<BR>
<BR>
Physical disabilities &ndash; Using a tinted background   for presentations, enlarge font size, use of dictation software<BR>
<BR>
Autism   spectrum disorders - produce visual or talking timetables<BR>
<BR>
Speech,   language and communication needs &ndash; use sorting activities (e.g. Textease, IWB),   use props to encourage pupils to talk more &ndash; e.g. video recorders, digital   cameras<BR>
<BR>
Cognition and learning difficulties &ndash; moderate learning   difficulties (MLD) and specific learning difficulties (SPLD) &ndash; support written   tasks with mind maps<BR>

<H1>Building Schools for the Future</H1>
<BR>
The aim of a &ldquo;Building Schools for   the Future&rdquo; session for students is to lift their eyes to the horizon &ndash; to think   about the future and how the shape of education might change over the period of   their forthcoming careers.<BR>
<BR>
Building Schools for the Future (BSF) is the   biggest single government investment in improving school buildings for over 50   years. The aim is to rebuild or renew every secondary school in England over a   10-15 year period. Some of your students may have come from recently rebuilt   schools; some will only know the older traditional buildings. However, all   students need to be aware that the tide is turning, that the learning   environment is changing and being modernized and that new technologies are a key   part of new developments. Students can find out more about BSF from visiting the   website:<BR>
<BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/resourcesfinanceandbuilding/bsf/" target="blank">www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/resourcesfinanceandbuilding/bsf/</A><BR>
<BR>
Some   ideas as to what schools are thinking of in terms of the future, particularly   with respect to ICT, is captured in a Teachers TV program entitled <em>ICT &ndash; a   vision of the future</em>. This can be viewed by accessing the Teacher&rsquo;s TV   website at:<BR>
<BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://www.teachers.tv/video/221" target="blank">www.teachers.tv/video/221</A><BR>
<BR>
The video shows the   experiences of 80 teachers who went on a 3 day bus tour to some of the most   imaginative and creative schools (secondary and primary) in the   country.<BR>
<BR>
However, at present BSF is not funding the rebuilding of primary   schools. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em>"We intend to provide new increased capital funding for both   primary and secondary schools by 2006. But we also recognise that their needs   are different. Recent capital investment has done much to improve primary   schools. Around 2,000 new classrooms have allowed infants to be taught in   smaller classes; and there are now reduced class sizes for many 7- to   11-year-olds. These investments have, in turn, supported big improvements in   literacy and numeracy, and in teaching and learning generally. Other investment   has provided new sports and arts halls. Primary schools are usually much smaller   than secondaries. This means that the scale of investment needed to improve   their premises is much more likely to be found from within the formulaic capital   funds provided to local education authorities, particularly if most secondary   school renewal is to be funded on a separate targeted basis. We will continue to   make additional investment available for primary schools."</em><BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Hence   students may find themselves working in schools where there is substantial   capital funding to be spent on improvements. Hopefully, they will be consulted   as part of the design process, but there is always the danger that any notions   about design may be predicated on schools that they are already familiar with.   How do we encourage them to think the unthinkable?<BR>
<BR>
A number of   interesting forward thinking scenarios with respect to primary schools are   available under the heading 'school in focus'. See:<BR>

<BR>
<strong>Self   Review Framework</strong><BR>
<BR>
Another aspect of planning for the future is to   ensure that the school has a clear strategy in terms of what it wants to   achieve, particularly with respect to ICT. From this point of view schools are   being encouraged to complete the Self Review Framework developed by Becta.<BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=srf&rid=11966" target="blank">http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=srf&amp;rid=11966</A>.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<em>"Becta&rsquo;s self-review framework is designed to help you evaluate   your current use of ICT and plan future improvements to the way technology is   used in learning and teaching. It can help ensure that your school&rsquo;s investment   in ICT is fit for purpose and you make best use of the resources   available.<BR>
<BR>
Freely accessed through an online tool, the framework is made   up of eight elements and linked to the national standards for ICT. It offers   your school a straightforward process for identifying strengths and areas for   development in current ICT use. After allowing you to benchmark your school&rsquo;s   capabilities against established best practice, the tool develops an action plan   to help move forward. <BR>
<BR>
The framework is divided into eight elements:
<OL>
<ul>
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=lv" target="blank">Leadership and management</A>
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=cu" target="blank">Curriculum</A>
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=tl" target="blank">Learning and teaching</A>
  <LI>Assessment  
  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=pd" target="blank">Professional development</A>

  <LI><A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=re" target="blank">Resources</A>
  <LI>Impact on pupil outcomes"
</ul>
 Becta produces a number   of publications which aim to help schools work through the process.<BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=srf&catcode=ss_to_srf_ben_02" target="blank">http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=srf&amp;catcode=ss_to_srf_ben_02</A><BR>
<BR>
There   are also a number of case studies where headteachers articulate how their school   has benefited from the process:<BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=srf&catcode=ss_to_srf_exp_02" target="blank">http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=srf&amp;catcode=ss_to_srf_exp_02</A><BR>
<BR>
The   lesson here for students is that any redesign of school buildings or   reassessment of school functionality can&rsquo;t be independent of a clear vision as   to where the school wants to go and what it wants to achieve. Such a vision must   involve staff, parents, governors and pupils. And sometimes the latter can be   remarkably perceptive, imaginative and truthful!<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Teaching   ideas</strong><BR>
<BR>
As a possible teaching session students can be sent in groups   of half a dozen to different primary schools. The aim is for them to talk to   pupils about how they (the pupils) might redesign their schools. One scenario   might be a blank sheet of paper and the school is being rebuilt from the ground   upwards whilst another scenario is that, given the basic school infrastructure,   how might the pupils refurbish it.<BR>
<BR>
Some of the questions to be addressed   include:
<UL>
  <LI>What features do you want to see in the school?  
  <LI>How many pupils should be in a class (if classes still continue to exist)?  
  <LI>What hours do you want the school to be open?  
  <LI>What subjects are important to learn?  
  <LI>How do you want to learn them?  
  <LI>What would make you want to come to school every day?</LI>
</UL>
The students   can present their findings in any way they think appropriate. They may produce a   Word report, they may produce a poster, a Powerpoint presentation, a blog, a   video diary, a wiki, a podcast.<BR>
<BR>
The aim of a session of this nature is   threefold. Students will be:
<UL>
  <LI>Asking pupils to articulate their thoughts about school and how they would   redesign the environment in which they spend a considerable time of their   formative years  
  <LI>Thinking about how well primary schools meet the needs of the child of the   21st century  
  <LI>Using the new technologies to present their findings in whatever manner they   see fit. They will need to bear in mind whether the audience is the staff or   pupils of the school, their peers or tutors.</LI>

<H1>Virtual Learning Environments</H1>
<BR>
A Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)   can be thought of as a computer program that enables users to engage in   computerised learning. VLE&rsquo;s are often called by other names such as LMS:   Learning Management System, CMS: Course Management System, e-Learning system,   MLE: Managed Learning Environment, etc.<BR>
<BR>
The real classroom is dead! I   think not. But things have moved on. If students and teachers need to   communicate then some sort of medium is certainly involved. Perhaps the simplest   method is to be in the same room and just talk. However, getting together can be   expensive or simply not practical. Also, teachers and students free time might   not coincide. So, people cannot get together in the real world, but they can in   the cyber world of the LP (learning platform).<BR>
<BR>
A VLE is used to help with   learning through the internet and ICT. It generally also has online storage and   various features to make content for lessons. An MLE (Managed Learning   Environment) as the M suggests is about the background support services that   enable learning online to happen. The term <em>Learning Platform</em> describes   ICT systems that support and enable learning. One of the main features of this   concept is the notion of personalized learning for the individual. To facilitate   this a VLE needs several key features to enable users to store their work,   communicate with each other, track progress, and give access to resources.   Obviously teachers and students have different access rights to different parts   of the system.<BR>
<BR>
Such systems are run on servers and the visible part of   the program often looks like internet pages. In the background managers can   access a host of features to do with the administration of the services. They   can monitor the learner&rsquo;s progress and keep a record of their inputs. Other   features include chat rooms, discussion forums and quizzes. Some VLE&rsquo;s systems   have blogs and RSS features.<BR>
<BR>
There is currently a Government target for   all schools in the UK to have some sort of personalised learning space by 2008   with a learning platform for all schools in place by 2010 as it is deemed a   useful learning tool that will supplement the face to face learning environment.   Tanya Byron has completed a report for Becta which outlines how ICT can be used   as medium to help keep parents informed without having to 'hassle' their   children. <A href="external.html?link=http://www.nextgenerationlearning.org.uk/ohnothingmuch/" target="blank">The Byron Report</A> includes statistics and more   information.<BR>
<BR>
A network of <A href="external.html?link=http://www.ja.net/communities/schools/networking/regional-broadband-consortia.html" target="blank">Regional Broadband Consortia</A> have worked together to bring   affordable broadband to schools in all local authorities. The link gives more   details of this.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Costs and roles</strong><BR>
<BR>
A basic learning platform   system may cost several hundreds of pounds per year to host; however, having   someone run it will involve additional costs. It seems sensible for roles and   responsibilities to be shared across the school with one named person as the   administrator, others would help create and maintain the material on the   system.<BR>

<strong>Activity</strong><BR>
<BR>
Make a list of six   essential features of a VLE. <BR>
Choose those which you consider to be most   relevant. <BR>
Measure the VLE which you have access to (possibly through your   educational establishment) against this list. Decide how effectively the VLE   supports your chosen features. Make suggestions for improvement and give it a   final score out of 36 (six points maximum score for each feature).<BR>
If   possible gain access to another VLE for comparison, or read the reviews or   adverts for other VLEs. Assess this in a similar   way.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Objectives</em><BR>
To have an awareness of what features are   considered appropriate for a VLE.<BR>
To be able to objectively evaluate a   resource, justifying reasons.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Key points</em><BR>
Try to think of the   objectives of the VLE when making your evaluation. How well does it achieve   these?<BR>
Try to think about the needs of the tutor and the needs of the   student. Do the same facilities serve both?<BR>
<BR>
<em>Success   criteria</em><BR>
Have you supported the score out of six with clear reasons for   the score?<BR>
Are you more aware of the features of VLEs which are   available?<BR>
