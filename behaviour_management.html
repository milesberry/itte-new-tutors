<H2>Introduction to Behaviour Management</H2>
<p><br>
  You have moved from being an experienced classroom practitioner to training prospective teachers. This section aims to support you when you address the subject of behaviour management with your trainees. Not only will you be able to pass on your own wealth of strategies to manage and avoid behavioural difficulties, you will find, in these pages, additional ideas and sources of information.<br>	<br>ICT raises behavioural issues that are not necessarily present in other lessons.  These may be partly to do with the technology itself, although this is less likely to be the case with your trainees, as ICT specialists, than for, say, a geographer using the computer room two or three times a week, and partly to do with different organisation and working practices in ICT lessons. One problem that is frequently identified is the room layout – pupils may be working with their backs to the teacher, or alternatively if the room is laid out so that the pupils are facing the teacher, the teacher cannot easily see the monitors to check that pupils are on task. The inflexibility of room layout means that the teacher is unable to make the environmental changes that can very often lead to improvements in behaviour in a non-specialist classroom, and therefore needs to consider strategies to achieve improvement through other means. <br><br>Further issues concern the fact that pupils often need to share equipment which makes setting tasks that require individual assessment difficult to manage and the teacher has to have awareness of the greater impact of a dominant character in groupings when sharing computers than other resources such as a text book; programs with sound make the lesson noisy or require the use of headphones which then make getting the pupils’ attention difficult; pupils being reluctant to pay attention to the teacher if the activity is engaging. <br><br>This section covers the following:<br><br>

<H1>Group activities</H1>
<BR>
The following list suggests four activities for   when you have the opportunity of working with your trainees as a group. The   topics covered are:<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Impact of classroom layout on pupil   behaviour</strong><BR>
<strong>Sources of help</strong><BR>
<strong>Developing Strategies for   Behaviour Management in the ICT room</strong><BR>
<strong>Group working</strong><BR>
<BR>
These   are supported with research routes for your own preparation, activity worksheets   and mini-case studies. Each activity could be developed into a session lasting   an hour to an hour and a half. The links with each activity lead to resources   and/or web pages that the tutor may find useful in his/her own preparation and   as working materials for trainees.<BR>

          <strong>Objective: </strong>For trainees to understand the need to adapt   teaching styles not just to the characteristics of the class but also to their   environment of the ICT room (Q31)<BR>
          <BR>
          The resource for this activity   comprises pages 10-15 from a BECTA Booklet giving guidance on room layout   published in 2001. This booklet is no longer available in its full form, but   these pages remain useful for generating discussion on room   layout.<BR>

          This   activity is intended to focus trainees&rsquo; minds on how the classroom layout can   impact on pupil behaviour, and more importantly the fact that very often the   teacher in a computer room may have no control over that layout. The teacher   accordingly has to devise strategies to deal with issues that they perceive   arise from the inflexibility of the room layout.<BR>
          <BR>
          You may find it useful   to refer to the section in this website on <A href="text_only6f27.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=13&ts=4">classroom   layout and management</A> as part of your preparation for this seminar   activity.<BR>

          The very   nature of classroom activities in the ICT room &ndash; the temptations for pupils to   stray off task, the difficulties of giving one-to-one support in large classes,   the occasional necessity to deal with technical problems, the problems of   finding effective tasks that differentiate in order to be sufficiently   challenging for the more able and yet are accessible to the weaker pupils &ndash;   makes it extremely likely that all trainees at some stage will have encountered   behavioural problems of different levels of   severity.<BR>
          <BR>

          Where   computers need to be shared, or group activities are to take place, significant   planning must be given as to how those groups or pairings should be made up.   Ability groupings in ICT lessons is a particularly interesting area to explore   as there may not always be correlation between academic and ICT ability in the   pupils. Furthermore, the stronger pupil in terms of academic and/or ICT ability   is likely to be the more dominant and want to manage the mouse which presents   accessibility, understanding and teacher assessment problems for the partner(s). <BR>
          <BR>
          <strong>Activities</strong><BR>
          - Group discussion to identify the appropriateness   of the grouping models to ICT activities. The discussion should show awareness   that consideration needs to be given to impact on pupils with special needs,   including the gifted and talented. It should also consider whether the type of   classroom task being undertaken has an impact on the grouping model. A snowball   discussion technique could be used &ndash; 2/3 minutes formulating thoughts   individually in silence, 2/3 minutes discussion with a partner exchanging ideas,   then pairs join to make groups of four for further pooling of ideas and so on   until the discussion involves the whole group.<BR>
          - Trainees to develop one   grouping model that they will trial at the next appropriate opportunity and   evaluate its effectiveness. They should justify their decision for the grouping   model they have chosen. <BR>
          <BR>
          Follow-up - trainees to feedback on the grouping   model they have trialled with individual or group review and   evaluation.<BR>

<H1>Heading off problems</H1>
<BR>
<strong>Resources and discussion points on the   importance of efficient and effective planning to avoid behavioural problems and   disaffected pupils</strong><BR>
<BR>
The circumstances that the ICT teacher finds   him/herself in are very different from any other class in the school. Although   similar to other practical rooms, such as the science lab or the food technology   rooms, it is probably the only subject where generally the whole lesson is   dependent on the specialist equipment. Problems with the specialist equipment   make it very likely that not only will the lesson objectives not be met, but   that no meaningful activity has taken place. <BR>
<BR>
A group of ICT teachers was   questioned as to the behavioural challenges they face in the classroom. They all   cited problems occurring from issues of a generic nature, not specifically   ICT-linked, such as the task not being at the right level, not ensuring the   class is listening before giving instructions, dealing with unacceptable   interactive behaviour between pupils. However, as a group they also identified   the following planning issues which, as experienced teachers, they have come to   realise are essential to ensure that as few problems as possible arise during   the lesson, which otherwise would lead to lack of engagement with the topic.
<UL>
  <LI>Where computers need to be shared, or group activities are to take place,   significant planning must be given as to how those groups or pairings should be   made up. Should they be through friendship, ability or computer competence? Who   manages the mouse? Who keeps the written record of findings? This particular   area for discussion is suggested as a <A href="text_onlyb5e2.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=13&ts=2">group   activity</A> with your trainees.  
  <LI>The teacher researching, at home, websites for use in the classroom must   check that they are accessible to the pupils via the school&rsquo;s filtering system.  
  <LI>Checking that websites are current and live &ndash; these change frequently.   
  <LI>Ensuring that the correct software is in place to safeguard pupils'   accessibility to websites (guidelinesat <A href="external.html?link=http://publications.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?resID=32424&page=1835" target="blank">http://publications.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?resID=32424&amp;page=1835</A>).   Pupils arriving at inappropriate websites has the potential for huge levels of   disruption.   
  <LI>Clear and achievable targets must be set for the pupils. These should have   been trialled by the teacher. For example, if search engines are to be used for   research, the teacher must have researched the routes in order to provide pupils   with key words that are navigable to a known outcome.  
  <LI>A plentiful supply of relevant and engaging activities in the event of   technical failure, or for assigning to the pupil who it is felt should be denied   access to the computer, e.g. worksheets, discussion topics, planning tasks for   next assignment.  
  <LI>Meticulous planning for the speedy keyboard operator and differentiation.   This can be more of a challenge for the teacher than desk-based activities   because the types of activities that take place in the computer suite may mean   there is not the option to 'turn to the next chapter'. Extension tasks need to   be meaningful, relevant and engaging.</LI>
</UL>
There are other types of   inappropriate behaviour which are specific to computer activities. While they   may not be considered a problem from the point of view that they do not cause   disruption to other pupils, behaviour which impedes the rate of production and   the ability of individual pupils to achieve their expected outcomes from the   lesson also needs to be addressed. These may include the following (with   suggested approaches):<BR>
<BR>
1 The pupil who spends unacceptable amount of time   designing headings, searching for graphics, changing font sizes<BR>
<BR>
Strategy   suggestions:
<UL>
  <LI>create a template/writing frame for the activity which pre-determines font   size, position of graphics etc  
  <LI>build up on the school network a library of graphics appropriate for the   activity  
  <LI>set homework tasks ahead of the session for design, accessing graphics   etc</LI>
</UL>
2 End of lesson cry &lsquo;Oh dear, miss, I&rsquo;ve lost all my work. I did   loads, honestly.&rsquo;<BR>
<BR>
Strategy suggestion
<UL>
  <LI>Every five-ten minutes a call for a whole class &lsquo;save-break&rsquo; &ndash; everyone   stops work, saves, with teacher observing those who may potentially experience a   &lsquo;problem&rsquo;. </LI>
</UL>
3 Students constantly needing help with software   issues.<BR>
<BR>
Strategy suggestion:
<UL>
  <LI>Teacher to consider whether students have the ICT skills to complete the   task and investigate/provide workshops or introductory session for those less   ICT literate  
  <LI>Differentiated activities &ndash; balance of ICT-based work and desk-based   production  
  <LI>Working in groups/pairs</LI>

<strong>Issues</strong><BR>
<strong>Reviewing Room   Layouts for the Computer Suite</strong><BR>
<strong>Managing the Wireless   Classroom</strong><BR>
<strong>Links to and Brief Reviews of Remote Control   Software</strong><BR>
<BR>
<strong>Issues</strong><BR>
Trainees need to be aware of the problems   they are likely to face when working with different layouts, as well, of course,   as features of the layout that they can use to their advantage. <BR>
<BR>
As in   all subjects, the layout of the room, the availability of resources and tools   and effective classroom management can have a significant impact on pupil   behaviour. Unfortunately, the ICT room, unlike a non-specialist classroom,   cannot be re-arranged at the beginning of the lesson to suit an individual&rsquo;s   teaching style and preferences. Furthermore, trainee teachers are unlikely to be   in the position of being able to introduce new software or make sweeping changes   to the layout of an ICT room. Such changes generally involve huge technological   planning, are normally very expensive and are likely to form part of a   whole-school policy.<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, some trainees may find themselves   in the fortunate position of training in a school that is undergoing upgrading   with the trainee being given the opportunity to provide input to the planning   discussions. <BR>
<BR>
Increasingly too, of course, schools are introducing   wireless networks and while these bring exciting opportunities, with some   drawbacks which are reviewed later in this article, the flexibility they offer   in determining classroom layout means the teacher will have control over the   classroom layout and needs to give serious consideration to the potential impact   on behaviour of different seating arrangements.<BR>
<BR>
The core dilemma with   room layouts almost invariably centres around: <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>- pupils sitting at computers with their backs to the teacher which   facilitates frequent, easy and non-confrontational checking that pupils are on   task<BR>
  <em>versus</em><BR>
  - pupils sitting at computers facing the teacher which   facilitates frequent eye contact and creates an improved environment for   building pupil/teacher relationships<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<strong>Reviewing Room Layouts   for the Computer Suite</strong><BR>
<strong>The BECTA website</strong> offers several pages   covering the design of the ICT suite which covers issues additional to the basic   layout.<BR>

<BR>
<strong>Managing the Wireless Classroom</strong><BR>
As suggested above, the   basic issues over classroom arrangement and the potential for impact on pupil   behaviour will be the same whether the computers are fixed in the computer suite   or pupils are using wireless laptops in the classroom. The main difference of   course is that the teacher has flexibility and control over the arrangement. For   example, laptops screens can be positioned facing several different directions   depending on the attitude and behaviour of individual pupils. <BR>
<BR>
Pupils can   be arranged in a variety of groupings according perhaps to behaviour issues or   simply for convenience for the work being undertaken or proximity to relevant   classroom resources. Older trusted pupils, or younger pupils with teaching   assistants, can even work in other rooms away from the main classroom, such as   the library. All of this can make the environment and work more interesting and   engaging for both pupils and teacher which in turn has the potential to impact   significantly on behaviour.<BR>
<BR>
However, managing a bank of laptops can also   present challenges which if they not foreseen and addressed have the potential   to disappoint pupils and provide some very interesting opportunities for   misbehaviour!<BR>
<BR>
These include:
<UL>
  <LI>Check in sufficient time ahead of your session that any necessary charging   of batteries will have taken place.  
  <LI>Consider the physical location of your bank of laptops &ndash; does the time it   takes for them to reach the classroom eat into an unacceptable amount of lesson   time?  
  <LI>What is the procedure for setting up? Are the pupils involved? If yes, have   they been given a clear and structured procedure to follow to avoid waste of   time? If no and they are in the room what activity is organised to keep them   meaningfully occupied without distraction?  
  <LI>Timing for closing computers down needs to be planned carefully; not enough   time allowed and the next session is affected, or pupils become angry at lost   break time or they rush the process with the potential for damage; too much time   allowed and hands-on time is lost and pupils may be at a &lsquo;loose   end&rsquo;.</LI>
</UL>
<p>In addition to the obvious benefits for behaviour management that   laptops have in terms of teacher control over the classroom layout, teachers   were asked about benefits that would not be available with the traditional fixed   computer suite. Here are a few:<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>&ldquo;I have a &lsquo;lids down&rsquo; call &ndash; all   pupils have to lower the lids of their computers. Means I have eye contact and   they can&rsquo;t be distracted by the screen.&rdquo;</em><BR>
  Maggie<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>&ldquo;We took a   couple of laptops onto the field to record our plant survey. The children felt   very important!&rdquo;</em> Duncan<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>&ldquo;Pupils feel a sense of ownership over a   laptop that they carry to their own table. Low level vandalism of equipment has   plummeted."</em> Andy<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>&ldquo;We allow our older pupils to move around the   room with their laptops to share data in research projects. Previously in the   computer suite they were shouting to each other to &lsquo;come and see this&rsquo; or   running back and forth across the room to look at each other&rsquo;s findings.   Somehow, carrying a laptop seemed to make them calmer and more responsible.&rdquo;</em> Lyn<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Examples of Software to support Classroom and Behaviour   Management</strong><BR>
  (in alphabetical order)<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>NetOp School</strong><BR>
  A wide   range of interesting applications. Of particular interest for behavioural issues   is the lock screen, keyboard and mouse facilty so the teacher can : get   everybody's attention by locking a keyboard, mouse or student's screen.<BR>
  <A href="www.netop.html" target="blank">www.netop.com</A><BR>
  <em>&ldquo;It allows me to take   control of all (or some) screens, send a &lsquo;Hands Free and Look at Me&rsquo; message   onto their monitors, locks the keyboard and mouse, and they have no alternative   but to look at me and see the point of the lesson&rdquo; </em>-   Paul<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>NetSupport School</strong><BR>
  <A href="external.html?link=http://www.netsupportsoftware.com/" target="blank">http://www.netsupportsoftware.com/</A> <BR>
  provides teachers with   the ability to instruct, monitor and interact with their students either   individually, as a pre-defined group or to the overall class.<BR>
  <em>&ldquo;Means I   don&rsquo;t have to move around the room so much so I can keep an overview and check   no-one is messing around behind my back&rdquo;.</em><BR>

  <BR>
  <strong>Ranger Remote   Control</strong><BR>

  <em>&ldquo;I   can look at pupils&rsquo; work while they are working and then send them a message &ndash;   if I try and call out a reminder while they are working I am usually just a   noise in the background which they don&rsquo;t really listen to.&rdquo; </em><BR>

  <em>&ldquo;I   can keep an eye on the ones I know go off task without seeming to be nagging   them all the time. It also makes demonstrating so much easier&rdquo; </em><BR>

  <em>&ldquo;locks   their keyboards and mice when I need to talk to them - works a   treat&rdquo;</em><BR>

  <BR>
  <strong>The case against remote control   software</strong><BR>
  <em>&ldquo;I think it is important that pupils maintain eye contact   with me when I am talking, so I can check understanding, rather than having   their eyes glued to the screen all the time I am explaining something to them&rdquo; </em>&ndash; Steve<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>&ldquo;Why should I turn the screen off for them when they need   to develop self-discipline and turn their monitors off themselves when I ask   them to?&rdquo;</em> - Kenny<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>&ldquo;It creates panic &ndash; they start shouting that all   their work&rsquo;s lost&rdquo; </em>- Naomi<BR>
  <BR>
  <em>I prefer the personal touch - remote   control software presents a real danger that I don't interact enough with   individual pupils"</em> - Faye<BR>
