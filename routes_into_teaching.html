<H2><B>Routes into Teaching</B></H2>
<br>As a newly appointed teacher training tutor, you may initially be aware only of the courses with which you have direct contact. It is useful to know about the alternative routes into teaching as, at some point, you may be required to contribute to other programmes or become involved in the development new courses or the assessment of trainees following other routes into teaching.<br><br>For convenience, the routes described here are organised into three sections:<br>•  School-based routes<br>•  Combined routes<br>•  HEI-based routes<br><br>Further, more detailed information can be found at:<br><a href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/Home/Recruit/becomingateacher/waysintoteaching.aspx" target="blank">http://www.tda.gov.uk/Home/Recruit/becomingateacher/waysintoteaching.aspx</a><br>and at<br><a href="external.html?link=http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/wiki/Routes_into_Teaching" target="blank">http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/wiki/Routes_into_Teaching</a><br><br><b>School-based routes<br><i>The New Role for Schools in Initial Teacher Training</i></b><br>The establishment of Training Schools was proposed in the 1998 Green Paper Teachers: meeting the challenge of change. The proposal was for a network of high quality Training Schools to develop and disseminate good practice in initial teacher training, train mentors and undertake research.<br>The aim is to build up and share good and developing initial teacher training (ITT) practice with other schools and their training providers, both within their existing partnership networks and beyond. Successful schools will already have shown good practice in teacher training and, with their new status as Training Schools, they will receive extra funding, through the Standards Fund, to carry out their training activities.<br><br><b><i>The Training Schools Programme</i></b><br>This was launched in 2000, with 82 schools given an annual grant of to provide staff cover, do outreach work and buy equipment.. The aim of the programme continues to be to develop and disseminate more innovative approaches to initial teacher training work, spread good practice, conduct research and train teachers to act as mentors to trainees.<br><br>A recent OFSTED report <a href="external.html?link=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Publications-and-research/Browse-all-by/Education/Teachers-and-teacher-training/Phases/Primary/An-evaluation-of-the-Training-Schools-Programme/(language)/eng-GB" target="blank">‘An evaluation of the Training Schools programme’</a> found schools engaged in the SCITT programme raise standards by motivating staff and encourage them to analyse their own practice.<br><br><b><i>School Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT)</i></b><br>School-Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT) offers a distinctive form of post-graduate initial teacher training, since it is based in schools and run by them. The trainee experiences a thorough preparation for the practice of teaching whilst studying for the academic qualification of PGCE. For trainees, one of the most significant advantages of SCITT training is that they are always in a classroom environment, acquiring the knowledge and skills required for effective teaching. For schools, involvement in SCITT brings considerable benefits, since all participating teachers have to analyse their teaching as part of the process of training the next generation of teachers, and the whole school gains a new professional dimension by devising and running a course of training.<br><br>Groups of schools take the lead in designing the training programme, and may choose to work closely with a range of partners, including higher education institutions, local education authorities and others. Some schools ask a Managing Agent, for example, a higher education institution, local education authority, or other organisation, to take responsibility for certain aspects of the provision, such as the administrative and financial aspects, quality assurance or co-ordination of the course.<br>Schools and colleges of all kinds can be involved: primary, middle, secondary, sixth form, further education; large and small; Local Authority-maintained and independent. Their common characteristic is their enthusiasm to provide high quality training for tomorrow's teachers, in a context where trainees learn from good practice<br><br><b><i>School Roles in a SCITT</b><br>The professional tutor <br>•  Takes responsibility for ensuring the whole school is prepared to support the trainee <br>•  Provides a suitable context for learning and professional development<br>•  Organises the school based professional development programme<br><br><i>The subject tutor </i><br>•  Works most directly with the trainee teacher<br>•  Negotiates individual training programme with the trainee and ensures its delivery<br>•  Organises the teaching timetable, briefs and debriefs teaching episodes, provides regular feedback on progress <br>•  Judges the evidence against the ‘standards for the award of QTS’<br>•  Liaises with the professional tutor and other teachers in the school working with the trainee.<br>•  Writes the report, the reference, and assesses the trainee’s teaching<br><br><b>Combined routes<br><br><i>Employment Based Teacher Training (EBTT)</i></b><br>The Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP) and Registered Teacher Programme (RTP) offer employment-based training routes into the profession. While following a training plan that leads to Qualified Teacher Status, trainees are employed by schools as unqualified teachers.<br><br>The programmes have proved particularly suitable routes to qualification for mature people with financial responsibilities; for people from ethnic minority groups and for people with previous experience in schools, for example, as classroom assistants and instructors. They have also helped many schools to find suitable staff for difficult to fill posts and to train them on the job.<br> <br>The GTP route is open to graduates with a first degree (or equivalent). The TDA can pay schools a grant towards the cost of employing a trainee, plus a payment to the school or training provider to cover training costs. Since September 2002, most GTP places have been allocated to schools by a network of over 90 Designated Recommending Bodies (DRBs). These bodies are all experienced and successful providers of employment-based teacher training, and are responsible both for the selection of trainees and for matching trainees with suitable schools in the areas they serve. <br><br><b><i>The Registered Teacher Programme (RTP) </i></b><br>This is open to people who have been accepted onto a programme leading to a first degree (or equivalent qualification) and who have some higher education or comparable education. When employing an RTP trainee, schools need to work in partnership with a higher education institution, since participants must complete a degree at the same time as qualifying as a teacher. Trainees on the RTP must also have GCSE grade C or above (or equivalent) in mathematics and English (and science for those training to be primary teachers). The RTP is a two-year course unless the participant already has considerable teaching experience when it may be possible to reduce the training to a year. <br><br>The school pays a salary, usually the minimum level on the unqualified teacher scale. The TDA pays a training grant each year to the school or body that is organising the training to help cover the costs. <br>The total number of GTP available places rose from around 4,750 in 2003/04 to 5,250 in 2004/05 and 6,000 in 2005/06. The latest figues from the TDA indicate there were around 4,000 places in 2007/8.<br><br><b><i>Overseas Trained Teacher Programme (OTTP)</i></b><br>Anyone who qualified as a school teacher in another country will need to gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) before s/he can work as a permanent, qualified teacher in England. The TDA's Overseas Trained Teacher Programme gives Overseas Trained Teachers (OTTs) the opportunity to gain QTS while they work in a school. <br><br>Special arrangements give Overseas Trained Teachers the option of presenting themselves for QTS assessment without further training. If an OTT needs training to help them prepare for QTS assessment, the TDA will pay a training grant to the Recommending Body. <br><br>On the OTT programme the school pays the trainee's salary. Overseas Trained Teachers with at least two years' teaching experience may be eligible for assessment against the Induction Standards and QTS Standards at the same time. Those who are successful will be exempted from serving an induction period. <br><br>For more information on Employment Based routes into teaching, visit the TDA webpage - <a href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/partners/recruiting/ebr.aspx" target="blank">Employment Based Teacher Training</a> <br><br><b>HEI based routes<br><br><i>Bachelor of Education (BEd)</i></b><br>The B.Ed. tends to be the route followed by those training to become primary teachers. B.Ed.s can be a two-, three- or four-year degree combining teacher training with subject knowledge and professional studies. Sometimes the four year programmes are referred to as 2+2 courses – two years spent studying a subject to degree level plus two years studying how to teach. Students graduate as a qualified teacher and hence can go straight into teaching.<br>Usually, students need two A levels to apply for a three- or four-year B.Ed. but some universities and colleges offer places without them if the students have other qualifications or relevant experience. The two-year shortened B.Ed. is designed for people with additional qualifications or experience – for example an HND – in certain priority subjects.<br>Some institutions offer part-time B.Ed. courses, which can take up to five years.<br><br><b><i>BA / BSc with QTS </i></b><br>Some undergraduate programmes offer the opportunity to combine a subject degree – usually a BA (Bachelor of Arts) or BSc (Bachelor of Science) – with training to be a teacher. These programmes are offered as either full- or part-time study. <br>Full-time study allows students to combine subject and professional studies with school-based training for a minimum of 24 weeks for three-year courses or 32 weeks for four-year courses. Part-time study takes up to five years, with school-based training for a minimum of 32 weeks.<br><br><b><i>1 year PGCE courses</i></b><br>Post Graduate Certificate in Education courses focus specifically on enabling students to meet the requirements for QTS. For entry to postgraduate Initial Teacher Training, students need a relevant degree or equivalent qualification. Generally, trainees spend at least 18 weeks of the year in school if they are intending to become primary school teachers, or 24 weeks for secondary. Usually, secondary teachers specialise in teaching the subject they have been studying at university, but some students opt to take a short intensive subject support course prior to the start of ITT to acquire additional subject knowledge needed to teach another subject. This is not often the case for ICT courses, however.<br><br><b><i>2 year PGCE courses</i></b><br>A few HEIs offer full-time ITT over two years to give students time to study additional subjects in greater depth - usually (though not exclusively) secondary subjects such as design and technology, mathematics, modern foreign languages and science.<br><br><b><i>Flexible Postgraduate ITT</i></b><br>The flexible modular PGCE enables trainees to receive high quality, individualised training that matches their needs and circumstances. The training and assessment is broken up into flexible modules allowing the trainee to negotiate the best time to complete the training. Training may be undertaken in the evening or weekends, via distance learning packages or an intensive full-time programme over a short time.<br><br><b><i>Fast Track </i></b><br>Some HEIs offer a fast track route into management positions in teaching. The programme, which operates only in England, is designed to develop and support post graduates with the potential to achieve excellence in teaching and school leadership, and is based on tailored development activities. Only those who are considered likely to become outstanding classroom teachers, heads of department or head-teachers are recruited. Candidates are expected to demonstrate that they have exceptional levels of subject knowledge, communication skills and the ability to inspire.<br>Students on the fast track route complete a year of augmented ITT, then work through a structured programme of challenging teaching posts designed to introduce them to a diverse range of experiences. They can also study for additional higher level qualifications, undertake special projects and participate in programmes offered by the National College for School Leadership. <br>See:<br><a href="external.html?link=http://www.fasttrackteaching.gov.uk/" target="blank">http://www.fasttrackteaching.gov.uk/</a><br><br><b><i>Teach First </i></b><br>The Teach First programme is designed to provide a route into secondary teaching for high flying graduates who aspire to leadership roles. The two year programme places trainees in challenging secondary schools and, through a combination of school-based and university-based training, provides the trainees with the knowledge, skills and experience needed to teach successfully in secondary schools in challenging circumstances. The initial <a href="external.html?link=http://www.teachfirst.org.uk/news/ofsted" target="blank">evaluation by OFSTED</a> indicates that, whilst there are some aspects which are in needs of development, the programme is highly successful in recruiting, training and, most importantly, retaining trainees for a highly challenging role.<br><br>See<br><a href="external.html?link=http://www.teachfirst.org.uk/" target="blank">http://www.teachfirst.org.uk/</a><br><br><br>author: Richard Bennett & David Short<br><a href="javascript:mailform('r.bennett%%chester.ac.uk ','Richard Bennett & David Short')">email the author</a>
