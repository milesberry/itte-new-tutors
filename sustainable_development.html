<br><blockquote>"Education for sustainable development is about the learning needed to maintain and improve our quality of life and the quality of life of generations to come. It is about equipping individuals, communities, groups, businesses and government to live and act sustainably; as well as giving them an understanding of the environmental, social and economic issues involved.

Your role as a tutor is to raise trainees’ awareness of ESD issues in relation to ICT and to help them consider how to incorporate ESD in their teaching.  ICT is not the subject most naturally associated with ESD, but there are a number of links which may be made.  Perhaps more importantly, thinking about sustainable development and global citizenship should make trainees, and subsequently their pupils, view their use of ICT more critically.

<H1><strong>What is Sustainable Development?</strong></H1>
<BR>
<strong>What is Sutainable   Development?</strong><BR>
&ldquo;Sustainable development&rdquo; is in itself a controversial term   with some arguing that it is a construct designed to appeal to &ldquo;apparently   opposed interest groups&rdquo; (Stables) and others pointing out that &ldquo;The sheer   proliferation of definitions of sustainable development is evidence of its   contestability&rdquo; (Carter 2001). However, arguably the most quoted definition of   'sustainable development' (Carter 2001, Worldaware.org) is from Gro Harlem   Bruntland, former Prime Minister of Norway and Director General of the World   Health Organisation, now a Special Envoy on Climate Change for the United   Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon:<BR>
<BR>
"development which meets the   needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to   meet their needs".<BR>
Brundtland 1987<BR>
<BR>
<strong>What is Education for   Sustainable Development?</strong><BR>
"Education for sustainable development is about   the learning needed to maintain and improve our quality of life and the quality   of life of generations to come. It is about equipping individuals, communities,   groups, businesses and government to live and act sustainably; as well as giving   them an understanding of the environmental, social and economic issues involved.   It is about preparing for the world in which we will live in the next century,   and making sure we are not found wanting."<BR>
(Sustainable Development Education   Panel, 1999)<BR>
<BR>
&ldquo;The key word is education for sustainable development, as   opposed to education about sustainable development, a more information-driven   concept. In contrast, 'education for sustainable development', like   'citizenship', is a holistic approach for a school's management and the   curriculum, not a separate subject.&rdquo;<BR>
(<A href="external.html?link=http://www.worldaware.org.uk/education/sustain.html" target="blank">http://www.worldaware.org.uk/education/sustain.html</A>)<BR>
<BR>
It   is concerned with learning to care for the environment, with a developing   awareness that this is not just a matter of personal behaviour or local   practice, but a concern with worldwide social, economic and ecological systems.   Sustainable Development thus includes geographic, economic, scientific,   technological, historical, moral and ethical knowledge, but what makes it a   coherent body of knowledge are seven key concepts (Sterling, 1998): <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><strong>Citizenship and stewardship</strong><BR>
  Recognises that people have   rights and responsibilities to participate in decision making and that everyone   should have a say in what happens in the future. This involves a willingness to   act as responsible citizens while developing the ability to engage with and   manage change at individual and social levels. Pupils are expected to know and   understand the connection between personal values, beliefs and behaviour and how   the school and community can be managed more sustainably.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Sustainable   change</strong><BR>
  Promotes an understanding that there are limits to the way in   which the world, particularly the richer countries, can develop. The   consequences of unmanaged and unsustainable growth might include increasing   poverty and hardship and the degradation of the environment, to the disadvantage   of everyone. This involves pupils in understanding how their home and school may   be managed more sustainably and beginning to question decisions, practices and   processes that affect sustainable development issues.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Needs and rights   of future generations</strong><BR>
  This concept is about learning how we can lead   lives that consider the rights and needs of others and recognising that what we   do now has implications for what life will be like in the future. This involves   pupils in discussing the way they live and the products and services they use,   to distinguish between actions and products which are wasteful and those which   are sustainable. This should enable pupils to begin to assess the sustainability   of their own lifestyle.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Interdependence</strong><BR>
  Involves an   understanding about the connections and links between all aspects of people&rsquo;s   lives and places at a local and global level, and that decisions taken in one   place will affect what happens elsewhere. Pupils should develop an understanding   that living things depend on each other and should acquire a sense that all   living things have value. This should lead to an understanding that what people   do elsewhere affects them, the places they live, other people, and plants and   animals. They should become increasingly aware of the global context within   which trade, industry and consumption operate.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Diversity</strong><BR>
  This   concept is about understanding the importance and value of diversity in people&rsquo;s   lives &ndash; culturally, socially, economically and biologically &ndash; and realising that   all our lives are impoverished without such diversity. Through learning, pupils   should appreciate cultural and biological diversity in the school and locality   and eventually be able to reflect critically on, and engage in, debates and   decisions on political, technological and economic changes which impinge on   diversity and sustainability.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Uncertainty and   precaution</strong><BR>
  Involves a realisation that because people are learning all   the time and that their actions may have unforeseen consequences, they should   adopt a cautious approach to the welfare of the planet. This implies   understanding that different people want to do things in different ways and are   able to listen to arguments and weigh evidence carefully. Pupils should thus be   able to think critically, systematically and creatively about sustainable   development issues, solutions and alternatives.<BR>
  <BR>
  <strong>Quality of life,   equity and justice</strong><BR>
  Recognises that for any development to be sustainable,   it must benefit people in an equitable way. It is about improving everybody&rsquo;s   lives. At a basic level this involves understanding the essential difference   between needs and wants and developing a sense of fairness. It involves   understanding the difference between quality of life and standard of living and   seeks a good quality of life for all people, at local, national and global   levels and an appreciation of why equity and justice are necessary to a   sustainable society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Huckle (2005) sets out a number of values and   skills associated with sustainable development which can be promoted by a   variety of subjects:
<UL>
  <LI>respect and care for the community of life, including the integrity of   ecological systems;  
  <LI>commitment to human rights, social and economic justice, and critical and   participatory forms of democracy;  
  <LI>commitment to tolerance, rationality, open mindedness, non-violence and   peace;  
  <LI>commitment to work with others to bring about more sustainable futures  
  <LI>skills for oral and written communication, numeracy and use of appropriate   ICTs, creative and critical thinking, problem solving, decision making and   planning, collaboration and cooperation, conflict management, and practical   citizenship  
  <LI>the technological, economic, political, social and psychological skills   needed to live more sustainably.</LI>
</UL>
&ldquo;Education for sustainable development   enables people to develop the knowledge, values and skills to participate in   decisions about the way we do things individually and collectively, both locally   and globally, that will improve the quality of life now, without damaging the   planet for the future.&rdquo; <BR>
(The [English] National Curriculum, QCA   1999)<BR>
<BR>
Teachernet identifies the importance of ESD stating that, &ldquo;Amid the   potential dangers are fantastic opportunities. Indeed, tomorrow&rsquo;s solutions may   be found by the children in our classrooms today". The site also identifies   opportunities for ESD across curriculum subjects, including ICT and also across   key stages, including the foundation stage curriculum. <BR>

<H1><strong>Why is ESD important?</strong></H1>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;I can tell you with assurance that global, sweeping, concerted   action is needed now. There is no time to waste. Slowing and even reversing the   effects of climate change is the defining challenge of our age.&rdquo;<BR>
  (UN   Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, launching the fourth assessment report of the   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 17 November   2007.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
For pupils, the importance of ESD lies in the fact that   children are our future citizens; they need to understand the basis of   decision-making concerning development in order to critically analyse current   policy and practice in the world around them and to make informed decisions   themselves now and in the future.<BR>
<BR>
ESD needs to permeate education. It is   not a distinct body of knowledge which can be applied in recognisable situations   but ignored most of the time, rather it is a way of thinking or &lsquo;frame of mind&rsquo;,   (Bonnett, 2002) which should influence all our activity. It would thus be   inappropriate to isolate it in the curriculum, and all teachers should take   opportunities to use the ideas of ESD in their teaching and provide models of   sustainable development thinking whenever possible in their work in   school.<BR>
<BR>
Huckle (2004: 25) sets out a number of questions teachers should   ask themselves about their practice and how their thinking might change with an   ESD perspective:<BR>

The English National Curriculum makes ESD statutory as <strong>a theme   for learning across the curriculum</strong>. It has a clear relationship with   citizenship and personal, social and health education (PSHE), and in terms of   programmes of study there are explicit requirements for ESD in geography,   science, design and technology, and citizenship.<BR>

<H1><strong>How does ICT relate to ESD?</strong></H1>
<BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"ICT promotes education for sustainable development through   developing pupils' understanding of the implications of ICT for working life,   society and the environment. <BR>
  <BR>
  ICT prepares pupils to participate in a   rapidly changing world in which work and other activities are increasingly   transformed by access to varied and developing technology. Increased capability   in the use of ICT promotes initiative and independent learning, with pupils   being able to make informed judgements, and consider the implications of ICT for   home and work both now and in the future. <BR>
  <BR>
  There are opportunities to use   sustainable development as a context for learning. Social, economic and   environmental issues can provide motivating contexts for developing a wide range   of ICT skills."<BR>
  (Teachernet 2006a)</BLOCKQUOTE>
During recent years, ICT has   proved to be a major influence on economic and social change. It already   pervades society and, as equipment becomes ever smaller and cheaper, becomes   accessible to an increasingly wider range of people. The effects of this are not   easily predicted, but technology&rsquo;s influence is unlikely to be neutral and there   is potential for it to be used positively or negatively in relation to   sustainability in development. One key issue to consider is that ICT devices are   now seen as consumer products which are subject to mass marketing and designed   for obsolescence. This results in increased energy consumption and large   quantities of waste material with consequent environmental effects. On the other   side of the balance, the promised paperless society has clearly not arrived   yet.<BR>
<BR>
ICT has enabled global connectivity to a degree that we are finding   hard to come to terms with; this feature could be a great force for promulgating   democratic values, but it is also fostering homogeneity and we may be losing   much valuable diversity of thought and practice globally. We also need to beware   of particular groups (commercial or political) seeking to dominate the Internet   for their own ends, of course.<BR>
<BR>
World economic systems are highly   dependent on ICT and we have seen how they are susceptible to attack from   viruses and the like. We may need to establish special principles of   sustainability for ICT in order to minimise the danger of systems experiencing   catastrophic breakdown worldwide. ICT is also a key business area for which   &lsquo;globalisation&rsquo; is rapid and this is having impacts on many developing   economies. The migration of manufacturing sites to the location of cheapest   labour, and the transfer of programming, data management and support services to   developing nations, can be seen as &lsquo;exporting of jobs&rsquo; from rich nations or as a   vital process of economic development for poor nations. <BR>
<BR>
We can also   consider the cultural impact of the Internet, and in particular of English as   the dominant language, and the implications this may have for cultural and   linguistic diversity. However, having a global language in addition to wide   variety of local ones can assist with the development of &lsquo;virtual communities&rsquo;   with membership worldwide.<BR>

<H1><strong>How can ESD help with developing ICT capability?</strong></H1>
<BR>
<BR>
An   understanding of the effects of ICT on the wider world is an important aspect of   ICT capability. The National Curriculum for ICT requires KS3 pupils to extend   the breadth of their study of ICT, including talking about the significance of   ICT to individuals, communities and society. This provides an opportunity to   discuss sustainability issues. Most GCSE syllabuses require teaching of the   social and economic impact of ICT as part of understanding in the subject, and   deeper study of sustainability issues is possible within this topic. One   syllabus (AQA full GCSE syllabus B) goes much further concerning the   relationship between ICT and society, specifying ideas such as:
<UL>
  <LI>how ICT can exaggerate the effects of actions (eg spam);  
  <LI>effects on small and remote communities;  
  <LI>tendency towards cultural homogeneity.</LI>
</UL>
The thinking about systems   involved in ESD should help with the analysis, design, development and   maintenance of ICT systems &ndash; and vice versa. ESD can provide a context and   rationale for teaching about communications and networking, using the idea of   world-wide community building. Teaching about new technologies and the future   impact of ICT can also be informed by sustainability principles, and the   teaching of critical evaluation of evidence and ideas found on the Internet can   be given a sustainability focus.<BR>

<H1><strong>How can ICT help with developing ESD?</strong></H1>
<BR>
Although it is perhaps   not strictly the remit of ICT tutors, it is worth considering how ICT can   contribute to ESD. There is potential when considering areas such as information   literacy to utilise ESD themes as these can provide useful exercises in 'using   and interpreting information'. Petrochemical and manufacturing companies'   environmental education materials may have a slightly different agenda to those   of campaigning organisations or charities. Digital video is increasingly   commonplace in classrooms and the use of ESD themes could provide a useful   context for this work with trainees. <BR>
<BR>
Carbon and ecological footprints   are useful when considering the environmental impact of individual actions. The   Royal Geographical Society, funded by the DfES, has put together a useful   website to use for looking at 'existing free e'learning tools' for these two   areas. (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.esd.rgs.org/" target="blank">http://www.esd.rgs.org</A>)<BR>
<BR>
In the context of ICT,   consideration of energy usage is important and discussions about leaving   electrical equipment on 'standby' are important. One resource that may stimulate   useful discussions is <A href="external.html?link=http://www.blackle.com/" target="blank">www.blackle.com</A>. The premise is that a black display on a   monitor uses less energy than a white equivalent so Blackle displays Google   searches in white on a black background. Pupils or trainees may wish to   investigate the legitimacy of this claim.<BR>

<H1><strong>Suggested activity for trainees</strong></H1>
<BR>
<em>Learning   objectives</em><BR>
<BR>
As a result of this activity, trainees should:<BR>
1. Gain   awareness of ESD issues and their relation with ICT.<BR>
2. Gain awareness of   forms of curriculum knowledge that encourage pupils to consider interactions   between economic, social, economic, political and cultural systems.<BR>
2.   Understand the role of Internet research in developing an understanding of   sustainable development.<BR>
3. Understand the role of ESD as a context for   learning to search the Worldwide Web for information and produce a report on a   specific brief.<BR>
4. Develop their skills in designing differentiated activity   for a range of learners.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Product</em><BR>
<BR>
Trainees will   produce:<BR>
1. a well researched oral report on one of the following issues:
<UL>
  <LI>What happens to old computers, phones etc when they die? Are they recycled?  
  <LI>In the UK, most homes have at least one PC. How much energy does this use?   What if every home in the world had a PC?  
  <LI>Does the use of ICT reduce the amount of paper used?  
  <LI>How many homes have PCs in other countries around the world? How many are   connected to the Internet?  
  <LI>How many people work in the ICT industry in different countries? What do   they earn?  
  <LI>Which companies are the biggest computer manufacturers worldwide? In the UK?   Where do they have their factories? Where are their components made?</LI>
</UL>
2.   a brief written description of how the information was obtained and manipulated,   including urls of helpful websites, and a reflection on what they learned   through this activity.<BR>
3. a similar activity appropriate for   KS3.<BR>
<BR>
<em>Structure of session</em><BR>
<BR>
1. Ask trainees for what they   understand by sustainable development, and write up ideas on board.<BR>
2. ask   trainees why they think ESD is a required aspect of the curriculum.<BR>
3. Ask   trainees how they think the issues of SD relate to ICT.<BR>
4. Explain that they   are going to carry out a task which they might in turn give to their students in   school.<BR>
5. Allocate them to groups of approximately four.<BR>
6. Display the   questions, allocate one to each group, and nominate one member of each group to   report orally to the class. Explain how you want the written report to be   structured and submitted individually at a later date.<BR>
7. Allow time to carry   out searches, select the information needed for the oral report and store the   references needed for the written report.<BR>
8. Ask for the oral report from   each group in turn, and allow other members of the class to ask questions &ndash; ask   some yourself if necessary! It is important that trainees decide what is or is   not sustainable about the present system of computer manufacture, distribution   and disposal. They should envision more sustainable alternatives and the   decisions needed to promote them.<BR>
9. Finally, ask each group to adapt their   question if necessary in order to be feasible for a KS3 class, and design any   extra structure that they would impose on the activity, for instance by   designing an electronic briefing document with urls and/or a report template.   Either ask for oral feedback on their decision if time during the session, or   ask them to submit the material for you to check and give feedback at a later   date.<BR>

<H1><strong>Suggested structure for mentor training</strong></H1>
<BR>
1. In advance of the   meeting ask mentors to find out how their school teaches about Sustainable   Development, and whether ICT is involved in teaching this theme.<BR>
<BR>
2. At   the meeting, ask each mentor to report briefly on their school&rsquo;s approach and   any ICT involvement.<BR>
<BR>
3. Explain to them about the activity which trainees   are carrying out in the HEI session, and suggest that trainees be allowed to try   out their KS3 activity with pupils and supported in implementing and evaluating   it.<BR>
