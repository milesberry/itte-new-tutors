<H2>Teaching and learning issues</H2>
<br>Some teaching and learning issues of interest to teachers of ICT are highlighted below and links are given to where materials may be found to support and develop ideas and strategies to enhance your trainees' work in these aspects.  In some cases we do not yet have any answers or the range of support and development resources is small because there has been little research in those areas. We welcome any suggestions for additions.<br><br>Issues identified by the National Strategy that currently relate to ICT departments in school are disseminated to schools via termly ICT Subject Leader Briefings - the documents to support these are eventually published on <a href="external.html?link=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/search/index.cfm?mode=advanced_results&amp;type=pub&amp;stRec=1&amp;nxt=1&amp;contains=%22ICT+Subject+Leader%22&amp;notContain=&amp;submit=Search&amp;sortOp=score&amp;summaryOp=show&amp;resultsOp=10" target="blank">Teachernet</a> and on the <a href="external.html?link=http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/search/?mode=basic_search&amp;pagenumber=1&amp;x=54&amp;y=11&amp;d=all&amp;search_string=%22ICT+Subject+Leader%22&amp;go=search" target="blank">Secondary Strategy</a> website.

Schools are expected to have a learning platform (Virtual Learning Environment - VLE) in place but as yet no clear description of the maturity of use stages has emerged. Many schools (and ITT establishments) may have not gone beyond using the repository function of these tools. The range of provison and the use of these tools to support learning might be worthy of a group investigation by a cohort of trainees on placement. These tools are seen by some as being a kingpin of the ability of a teacher to engage with and delliver the personalised learning agenda as defined by the Every Child Matters Agenda.<br><br><B>Personalised Learning</B> <I>see separate section for additional details</I><br>Identified by<blockquote>·	<a href="external.html?link=http://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/" target="blank"><I>Every Child Matters Agenda </I></a></blockquote><I>"This is what I mean by  “Personalised Learning”. High expectation of every child, given practical form by high quality teaching based on a sound knowledge and understanding of each child’s needs. It is not individualised learning where pupils sit alone at a computer. Nor is it pupils left to their own devices – which too often reinforces low aspirations. It can only be developed school by school. It cannot be imposed from above."  </I> David Millband 8th January 2004 <a href="external.html?link=http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/speeches/search_detail.cfm?ID=95" target="blank">Speech to North of England

for trainees:<blockquote><I>Pupils should be encouraged to use their first language in lessons when:<br><br>- the cognitive challenge is likely to be high: problem solving and critical<br>- thinking are difficult in a second language, even when the target language has been learnt for several years;<br>- they are still developing proficiency in English: this can be particularly supportive when pupils are trying out ideas in their first language before planning in English;<br>- oral rehearsal will help reflection: for example, when describing features of an effective presentation.<br>It may not be appropriate for pupils to use their first language when:<br>- pupils need to be encouraged to practise English to improve fluency;<br>- pupils are being encouraged to take risks in their spoken English in order to build confidence;<br>- pupils need to practise expressing themselves quickly in English, for examination preparation;<br>- pupils are learning technical or subject-specific language.</I></blockquote><B>Gender</B><br>Identified by<blockquote>·	Ofsted Annual Report 2002/03 Secondary (p7) </blockquote>Support and development resources<blockquote>·	Links to resources on

quality interactive teaching is oral, collaborative and lively. It is not achieved by lecturing the class, or by expecting pupils to teach themselves indirectly during practical work or from books. It is a two-way process in which pupils are expected to play an active part by answering questions, working together collaboratively atappropriate times, contributing points to discussions, and explaining and demonstrating their methods, conclusions and solutions to others in the class.”</I><br><br>·	ICT and Pedagogy (Section 1 p4, Cox et al, DFES/0793/2003) <I>“Using ICT with pupils in pairs, groups or with a whole class, through, for example, the use of an interactive whiteboard, enables teachers to gather extensive feedback from pupils by listening to their explanations. From this, teachers are able to gain deeper insights into pupils’ understanding and progress. Pupils collaborating in pairs or teams using subject-specific ICT resources are able to challenge each other’s understanding and learn from such collaborations.</I></blockquote><br>author: Neil Stanley<br><a href="javascript:mailform('n.r.stanley%%livjm.ac.uk ','Neil Stanley')">email the author</a>
