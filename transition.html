  of transfer and transition
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
The word &lsquo;Transition&rsquo; is   defined as &lsquo;a change from one place or state or subject or stage to another&rsquo; or   &lsquo;the period of time through which something changes&rsquo;. Transfer is defined as   &lsquo;the act of transporting something from one location to another&rsquo; (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.elook.org/dictionary" target="blank">http://www.elook.org/dictionary</A>). <BR>
<BR>
Transitions are an   inevitable part of our personal development. Everyone has to face considerable   changes at particular times in life. Most of us manage change successfully,   resulting in increased experience and maturity. However, some transitions are   difficult; particularly those we pass through as children or as young adults   when we may be less confident and secure about facing new   experiences.<BR>
<BR>
Transitions and transfers in education have been of interest   for some time. The Hadow Report in 1926 first suggested separate phases of   primary and secondary education with a break at the age of 11. It recognised the   key importance of the middle years of education and Barber (1999) suggests that   the same sentiment continues to apply today.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em><BR>
  &lsquo;There is a tide which begins to rise in the veins of youth   at the age of eleven or twelve. It is called by the name of adolescence. If that   tide can be taken at the flood, and a new voyage begun in the strength and along   the flow of the current, we think that it will move on to   fortune&rsquo;.</em><BR>
  <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The words transfer and transition, while having   slightly different meanings, are interchangeable in this resource as the   transfer between Primary and Secondary school is also a key transitional   period.<BR>

  <strong>Where to next?</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  The following links are designed to   help you support trainees in their understanding of the issues around   transition, possibly prior to carrying out their own research. <A href="text_only90a6.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=6&ts=3">The   Five Bridges</A> represents an excellent, current framework to support you in   developing trainees&rsquo; understanding of the range of transition issues faced by   schools.<BR>
  <BR>
  Maurice Galton is one of the principal researchers in this area.   The summary of some of his work in the <A href="text_only12bd.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=6&ts=4">Influential   research</A> summary section can be used to get a swift initial understanding of   key research abut transfer and transition in the last decade (although Galton&rsquo;s   research goes back further). There are a number of links to other relevant   journal articles and research reports which you might want to encourage trainees   to look at for self directed extended research for assignments.<BR>
  <BR>
  As   lecturers with an interest in ICT, you will want to refer to the role of ICT as   a tool to support transition. The <A href="text_only15ca.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=6&ts=5">Role   of ICT</A> in transition link gives a brief overview of some ways in which the   use of ICT can develop each of the Five Bridges and also suggests some   supporting resources for use with trainees.<BR>
  <BR>
  The <A href="text_onlycf29.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=6&ts=6">Supporting   Case Studies</A> provide lecturers with a summary of and links to recent   government sponsored research and case studies supporting transition. <BR>
  <BR>
  The <A href="text_only7685.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=6&ts=7">Recent   Thinking</A> link, gives you an overview of the latest news on transfer and   transition which will provide useful reading for trainees. <BR>

<H1>Five Transition Bridges</H1>
<BR>
Galton, Grey and Ruddock originally outlined   the five pivotal issues relating to transfer and transition in &lsquo;The Impact of   School Transitions and Transfers on Pupil Progress and Attainment&rsquo; (Galton, Grey   and Ruddock, 1999). The link to this can be found in the journal articles listed   in the <A href="text_only12bd.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=6&ts=4">Influential   Research</A> section of this resource.<BR>
<BR>
Later in the same year, Michael   Barber, at a conference in Melbourne, Australia, talked about the divide between   Primary and Secondary schools as a muddy river and urged schools to build   bridges to enable a smooth crossing. He saw large numbers of middle years pupils   continuing to fail without a national response to their needs in terms of   curriculum and pedagogic continuity and progression. He referred to the five   headings as used by Galton, Grey and Ruddock in their research for the DFES (now   DCSF), as &lsquo;the Five Bridges&rsquo;, the development of which, he saw as a necessary   prerequisite to smooth transition or transfer. It is worth reading Barber&rsquo;s   paper, Taking the Tide at the Flood: Transforming Education in the Middle Years   (1999) from the New South Wales Educational Board of Studies site. It gives us a   flavour of the Galton, Grey and Ruddock research and is a passionate endorsement   of proposed policy to tackle these fundamental transition issues.<BR>

The   Five Bridges of transition are:
<UL>
  <LI><strong>The bureaucratic bridge</strong> - including arrangements for the   communication of pupil records both personal and academic and administrative   meetings between school staff.  
  <LI><strong>The social bridge</strong> &ndash; to ensure that primary pupils become familiar   with their secondary school prior to transition and feel comfortable and   confident with the changes of teachers, key school routines, new peer group and   physical surroundings.  
  <LI><strong>The curriculum bridge</strong> &ndash; to ensure curriculum continuity between   phases so that secondary teachers can develop existing levels of achievement and   attainment rather than seeing the secondary curriculum as a &lsquo;blank slate&rsquo;.  
  <LI><strong>The pedagogic bridge</strong> &ndash; to develop cross phase links between teachers   of Year 6 and 7 to ensure a consistency in pedagogic approaches in the   classroom.  
  <LI><strong>The management of learning bridge</strong> &ndash; to ensure that pupils are aware   of the challenges of transition and are given the opportunity to make their own   decisions and to add their voice as active participants in the   transition.</LI>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Barber (1999)</BLOCKQUOTE>
Galton and his colleagues suggested in   their research, that there had been progress relating to bureaucratic and social   continuity but the remaining bridges, particularly the fourth and fifth, were   still at an early stage of development in most schools. <BR>
<BR>
Over the past   ten years the five bridges have provided a framework for evaluating good   practice relating to transition. There are a number of documents and case   studies relating to transition written in recent years mapped against the Five   Transition Bridges in the <A href="text_onlycf29.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=6&ts=6">Supporting   Case Studies</A> section.<BR>

  Transfer and transition &ndash; A summary of the findings of influential   research
</CENTER>
<p><BR>
  <BR>
  School transitions are characterised by a number of   challenges. Firstly, where there is a transfer from primary to secondary school,   this usually involves the movement of pupils from a small school and a single   class teacher to a large school community with several subject specialists   teachers. There is also the increased physical size of the school site and   buildings where lessons take place in random locations dictated by the   timetable. This requires navigation skills and more sophisticated spatial   awareness than demanded in a small primary or junior school. In addition, the   significant changes in class organisation, such as a variety of subject ability   sets, may break down familiar friendship groups. <BR>
  <BR>
  The research strongly   suggests that these challenges for the new pupil may contribute to dips in   motivation or attainment. However, does this necessarily lead to a breakdown in   progress? Galton et al (2000) suggests that there is a &lsquo;hiatus&rsquo; in progress   rather than a decline in progress. His study showed that, relative to the rest   of the class, those who did well at primary continued to do so at secondary even   if there was an initial dip in performance. It is the awareness of themselves as   secondary pupils and the changes in approaches to study that they seem to take   longer in coming to terms with. Galton cites Spelman who identified the pupils   most at risk as being less mature, less confident and from poor social and   economic conditions and less academic backgrounds. They had difficulty adapting   to the physical and academic organization, developing relationships with   teachers and understanding expectations in terms of standards of work. Not   surprisingly, those who were more successful were academically able, self   confident, socially mature and have strong parental support. (Spelman (1979)   cited in Galton et al 2000). <BR>
  <BR>
  By the end of the 20th century, the social   aspects of transition were perceived to be less of a problem. Many pupils, when   questioned later in school life, did not remember it as a time of huge   disruption. Most schools were familiarising Year 6 pupils with their new   teachers, the layout of the secondary school and basic daily procedures through   transition prior to the transfer. The introduction of transition events such as   induction and taster days and documentation to help familiarize pupils with the   secondary school seemed to be having an impact. Whole day induction visits   allowed primary pupils to use specialist facilities at secondary schools such as   gyms, science laboratories, design and technology workshops and ICT suites.   These days often included their primary teachers and, in some cases, parents and   carers were welcomed as well. They also ensured that the new cohort of pupils   would fit into the school and allow its systems to run smoothly and, in the   process, minimise disruption. Valuable as these strategies were, Galton felt   that for many headteachers, they were the major indicators of a successful   transfer rather than ensuring that learning continues at the same pace and with   appropriate challenge, continuity and progression. Galton also pointed out that   increased parental choice means that many secondary schools have a far greater   number of feeder primaries than previously so these links may only be with the   feeder schools providing the majority of pupils (Galton et al 2000). <BR>
  <BR>
  Galton claimed that most research into transition since the 1980s had   focused on the impact of the change of buildings and site rather than the effect   on academic performance. He suggested that the academic progress of around 40%   of children is affected by the transition. Since the beginning of this century,   there has been a growing emphasis both in research and practice on transition in   terms of pedagogy and curriculum continuity when changing schools (Galton et al,   2000). <BR>
  <BR>
  Galton describes the &lsquo;tabula rasa&rsquo; (Latin: blank slate) which is   commonly known as the &lsquo;fresh start approach&rsquo; in secondary schools. This is, at   worst, starting Year 7 as if the pupils know nothing, or, more commonly, the   retesting of pupils when they arrive at secondary school. This is still standard   practice today despite efficient communication of SAT results and far more   effective lines of contact between primary and secondary schools. Galton found   that secondary head teachers rarely examined the records of transition pupils   and preferred to use new data. Indeed, it is unlikely that subject teachers, who   may only teach individual classes once or twice a week, will carefully peruse   all transfer documentation. <BR>
  <BR>
  The National Curriculum was introduced in   1988 and was designed to promote curriculum progression and continuity between   key stages through the continuum of the levels in the attainment targets.   However, many didn&rsquo;t feel that Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 3 (KS2/KS3) in   particular, offered realistic and continual progression. This led to more   learning through subject specialisms at upper primary (KS2) in order to develop   skills, knowledge and understanding of discrete subjects before transfer and to   prepare children for moving on immediately they transferred to secondary school.   At the same time, Galton found that many secondary schools tried to ease   transition by keeping the &lsquo;primary&rsquo; ethos in Year 7 with fewer teachers and more   integration of subjects but found that this made no difference to overcoming a   hiatus in progress. These approaches are interesting in the light of the revised   KS3 curriculum which appears to encourage a more integrated approach to the   curriculum for lower Key Stage 3 pupils. The KS2 curriculum is to be revised   following the Primary Review by Sir Jim Rose, published in April 2009. Although   it seems that similar themes will be addressed in curriculum for each phase, it   will be interesting to see how far progression and continuity between the key   stages is considered and made explicit, whether in themes, in subjects or in   pedagogic approaches. <BR>
  <BR>
  In terms of curriculum continuity, the level of   challenge at secondary school was sometimes perceived to be at a lower level   than it had been in Year 6. (Suffolk LEA 1997). Again, there are echoes of the   &lsquo;tabula rasa&rsquo; as secondary schools did not appear to be looking at achievement   or attainment at Year 6 when designing their Year 7 curriculum. <BR>
  <BR>
  Many   secondary teachers saw attainment at Year 6 as somehow different from what they   saw as their own more sophisticated expectations in terms of what they wanted   pupils to understand in their subject. They did not trust the non-specialist   primary teachers. For example, a study of English teaching found that &lsquo;at   primary level, the teacher&rsquo;s main focus was on literacy skills with the emphasis   on creative writing; secondary teachers said that students&rsquo; response to   literature was their main concern&rsquo;. This showed the existence of an embedded   cultural difference of perspective between secondary and primary, the absence of   a common perception of understanding in the subject and a lack of harmonization   in approaches to teaching and learning. There was, and to some extent, still is,   a perception amongst secondary teachers that Level 4 at KS2 was just not the   same as Level 4 at KS3 (Galton et al, 2000). <BR>
  <BR>
  In the early years of this   millennium, there was clearly still room for improvement in terms of initiatives   for academic continuity and progression. A range of strategies, such as bridging   units or subject projects, were already emerging at this time, aimed at   developing a shared culture of teaching and learning across the transition.   Galton felt in 2000 that there had been insufficient evaluation of such   initiatives and called for further qualitative studies to try to evaluate   perceptions of progress. <BR>

  <strong>Reflection/discussion   points and resourcesfor use with trainees</strong><BR>
  <BR>
  Ask trainees to consider   the role of ICT as shown above and to suggest further ways in which ICT might be   used to support and develop the bridges.<BR>
  <BR>
  In terms of effective transition   in ICT as a subject, ask trainees to think about how ICT teachers could   contribute towards the building of the different bridges in ensuring a smooth   transition through the ICT subject curriculum. Trainees could investigate   published materials to support the teaching of ICT at key stage two and at key   stage three to help develop initial ideas.<BR>
  <BR>
  A useful ICT related text is   Chapter 9, Sharing perspectives across the phases of schooling in <em>Developing   the ICT Capable School,</em> (Steve Kennewell, John Parkinson and Howard Tanner,   Routledge/Falmer, 2000). This book, probably on most subject booklists, offers   an easily accessible ICT perspective on a range of approaches for ICT   departments to manage transition which are still applicable. It discusses the   five bridges and continuity and progression in the ICT curriculum in the light   of them. Web 2.0 tools, offer easier communication and may prove more effective   in supporting liaison so it may be useful to encourage trainees to consider the   strategies for transition in the light of advances in technology and their own   experiences in schools. In addition, there is consideration of the different   themes of the ICT curriculum (from the previous National Curriculum but easily   adaptable to the recent revised KS3 curriculum). This could be used as a   supporting resource for an activity in which trainees consider the Key Stage 2   curriculum and think about how specific ICT curriculum projects or shared   schemes of work could promote continuity, progression and engagement in ICT at   the start of Key Stage 3.<BR>
  <BR>
  Download <A href="external.html?link=http://foi.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?resID=35821" target="blank">Moving On: The Role of ICT in Transition</A> (2004) from the BECTA   website. It looks at a range of transition projects in schools that have   utilised ICT in building the five bridges and in doing so, have also provided   valuable contexts for developing ICT capability. Each example provides some   useful questions which can be adapted for use with ITE trainees of any   subject.<BR>
  <BR>
  The Teachers TV series, Hot Management has an episode, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.teachers.tv/video/2791" target="blank">Summer   Surfing</A>, in which a South London school provides an interactive link with   feeder primaries through a shared website. This could provide an excellent   stimulus for discussion with ICT trainees about which transition bridges this   project might contribute to. You might also discuss ways in which ICT tools   could be used in the development of Bridging Units, supporting curriculum   continuity and enabling shared pedagogical approaches across the transition. <BR>
  <BR>
  The <A href="text_onlycf29.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=6&ts=6">Supporting   Case Studies</A> section is an additional resource containing examples of   transition projects.

There are a number of interesting   publications and sets of case studies developed for the DCSF and DfES (former   name for DCSF). They are summarised below.<BR>
<BR>
<strong><em>Crossing The Bridge &ndash;   Case Studies in KS2 to KS3 transfer</strong><BR>
Published by the Association of   Assessment Inspectors and Advisors (AAIA) (2002)<BR>
<BR>
This contains nine short   case studies of different transition projects. They have been mapped against the   five bridges and include strategies such as master classes for Year 6 pupils,   staff exchanges, &lsquo;buddying&rsquo; of vulnerable Year 6 pupils, target setting across   the transfer period, sharing of perceptions of Level 5 in English, making use of   bridging units in core subjects (Maths and English) and encouraging personal and   learning skills across the transition.<BR>
<BR>
Case studies 1, 3, 6, 7 and 8 have   explicit elements of the use of ICT or aspects which aim to develop ICT   capability and curriculum continuity across the transition. These include the   use of shared web sites, use of email, production of purposeful multimedia   presentations, collecting, analysing and presenting data and individualised   support using ICT. Case study 7 relates to the use of SIMs for transfer of data   and case study 8 uses video for continuing professional development sessions   analysing teaching and learning.<BR>

<strong><em>Curriculum Continuity &ndash; Effective   transfer between primary and secondary schools.</strong><BR>
Published by the DfES   as part of the Key Stage 3/National Strategy (2004).<BR>
<BR>
This provides some   useful information about what constitutes curriculum continuity in English,   Maths, Science, ICT and the Foundation subjects. It also examines the purpose of   bridging units and has a useful summary of the Galton, Gray and Ruddock   research,<em> Transfers and transitions in the middle years of schooling (7-14);   continuities and discontinuities in learning.</em> It has an accompanying DVD   which looks at transitional issues from the perspective of school leaders,   teachers and pupils.

<BR>
<strong><em>London Challenge Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 3   Transition Project</strong><BR>
Published by the DfES (2005)<BR>
<BR>
A partnership   of four London boroughs carried out this project to &lsquo;develop innovative   solutions to ensure effective pupil transfer from primary to secondary schools&rsquo;.   Consultants, Mouchel Parkman, developed an approach to the evaluation of a range   of strategies used to support transition in order to identify those which   represented good practice. Again, the work is based on the five bridges and on   pages 4-8 they have produced an excellent table listing best practice within   each transition bridge.<BR>

<BR>
<strong><em>Strengthening transfers   and transitions &ndash; Partnerships for progress</strong><BR>
Published by the DCSF as   part of the National Strategies (2008)<BR>
<BR>
This booklet contains a series of   recent case studies from schools in seven Local Authorities, nationwide. They   identified seven key principles relating to the the curriculum bridge, the   pedagogic bridge and the management of learning bridge. One area of particular   interest is the consideration of how pupils can take control of their learning.   Most of the case studies are based on particular subjects or generic assesment   for learning strategies and are easily accessible, providing a lot of useful and   relevant ideas. It is worth considering how these case studies could use ICT to   support the implementation of the projects they describe.
