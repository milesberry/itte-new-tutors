<H2>Primary ICT Introduction</H2>
<br>This page has been designed for use by tutors and mentors who are responsible for the initial training of primary teachers. Its purpose is to provide an overview of the information, resources and links on the <b>ICT Tutors Website</b> which will be of most relevance to this audience. The original funding for setting-up the ICT Tutors website was to provide resources for those training secondary teachers. The remit has since widened to take account of those involved in all aspects of initial teacher education - including primary schooling - and the earlier resources have been updated to take account of that.<br><br><i>Keep checking this page, as new information and resources are added to the website, this page will be updated. In the meantime, if you find there is a vital piece of information missing, please email the author (see footnote) offering feedback and suggestions as to what could be added or amended.</i><br><br><b><a href="text_only6fba.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=2&tp=3&ts=1">Sources of support</a></b><br><blockquote>Information on how to tap into the <a href="text_only537d.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=2&tp=0&ts=1">induction support</a> which is provided for those new to teacher training.

In addition, some of the links to information about <a href="text_only949b.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=0&ts=1">learning styles and about the pedagogy of ICT</a> (ie how ICT affects the way pupils learn and hence how teachers teach) is relevant to any age group.<br><br>A recent addition to the ICT Tutors' website is the section on <a href="text_only2445.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=7&ts=1">Models of Teaching</a>, which provides information and resources for tutors designed to help students think about the teaching strategies used by themselves and others.

The <a href="text_onlyc765.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=5&tp=1&ts=1">E-assessment</a> section focuses on the role of ICT in the assessment process and use of e-portfolios.
