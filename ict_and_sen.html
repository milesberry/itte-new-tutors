<H2><b>ICT and Special Educational Needs</b></H2>
<br>As a new ICT tutor in Initial Teacher Training (ITT) you will be required to address issues about Special Educational Needs (SEN) and ICT.<br><br>Clearly, in any ITT course there will usually be a broader education or professional studies programme where SEN is addressed as a generic topic. Some ITT courses may offer SEN as a specialist study area.<br><br>The ICT tutor must address this aspect of teacher training in addition to the specialist elements from two main points of view:<ul><li>The role of the ICT teacher in supporting and advising teaching colleagues on the use of ICT in SEN teaching.</li><li>How to manage SEN pupils in the inclusive classroom.</li></ul>
<p>This document therefore provides starting points for the ICT specialist who is required to address these aspects of SEN.<br><br>author: David Longman, Lynne Jones, Richard Clarke and John Woollard (updated 2009 John Woollard)<br>

<H1><strong>Rationale </strong></H1>
<p><BR>
  &ldquo;Children have special educational needs if they   have a learning difficulty, which calls for special educational provision to be   made for them.&rdquo;<BR>
  (<A href="external.html?link=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/docbank/index.cfm?id=3724" target="blank">SEN Code of Practice</A>, DfES, 2001, 1:3)<BR>
  <BR>
  Pupils who access   support from within the normal resources of a school are identified in the SEN   Code of Practice (2002) as School Action and those who require the support of   external professionals are identified as School Action plus. Children whose   needs are thought to be long term may have a Statement of SEN.<BR>
  <BR>
  A pupil&rsquo;s   special educational need may arise from physical disability, sensory impairment,   behavioural/emotional problems or cognitive differences. The degree of   difficulty may range from mild to severe but learning opportunities should be   available equally to all. It may be necessary to involve specialist institutions   including:<BR>

<H1><strong>Historical perspective of SEN</strong></H1>
<p><BR>
  Until the 1980s a segregated   system of education excluded some pupils from mainstream schooling on the   grounds of a disability or learning difficulty. This discriminatory approach   became increasingly unacceptable to the point of being seen as a contravention   of human rights. Through the last two decades of the century, a succession of   Acts of Parliament changed the policy from exclusion to inclusion, from   segregation to integration.<BR>
  <BR>
  The Education Act 1944 established that   children's education should be based on their age, aptitude and ability. The   Handicapped Pupils and School Health Regulations in 1945 established eleven   categories of 'handicap': blind, partially sighted, deaf, partially deaf,   delicate, diabetic, educationally subnormal, epileptic, maladjusted, physically   handicapped and children with speech defects. At that time, the general   philosophy was that the child should fit the school rather than the school fit   the child. The concept of segregation (separate provision) was   established.<BR>
  <BR>
  In the 1970s, Mary Warnock was influential in establishing   the current procedures for supporting children with special educational needs.   The Warnock Committee was set up in 1974 leading to the publication of the   Warnock Report in 1978 and the 1981 Education Act. The report concluded that 20%   of children could have special educational needs but 2% might need support over   and above what a mainstream school could provide. The concept of integration was   established.<BR>
  <BR>
  The 1981 Act was eventually surpassed by the Education Act   1993 and then the Education Act 1996. The Secretary of State issued a Code of   Practice which gave practical guidance to local authorities and school governors   regarding their responsibilities for all pupils with special educational needs.   The concept of support and provision was established which included in-class   assistance for individuals and small groups.<BR>
  <BR>
  In 1995 <A href="external.html?link=http://direct.gov.uk/en/DisabledPeople/RightsAndObligations/DisabilityRights/DG_4001068" target="blank">The Disability Discrimination Act</A> offered protection from   discrimination to those with a physical or mental impairment in regard to   employment, access to goods, facilities and services or buying or renting land   or property. It did not address issues of education until 2002 when <A href="external.html?link=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2001/ukpga_20010010_en_1" target="blank">The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act (SENDA)</A> came   into effect with the result that educational institutions are no longer exempt   from discrimination against disabled students. <BR>

<H1><strong>Using ICT to support SEN</strong></H1>
<BR>
The use of ICT to support teaching   and learning is well established in current practice. Since the origins of   school-based computers, they have been used to support the education of pupils   with special educational needs.<BR>
<BR>
ICT can make a significant difference to   the life and learning of children with learning difficulties and there are four   main ways in which ICT can be used to meet the special educational needs of   pupils:
<UL>
  <LI><em>Assistive ICT</em>: An ICT device, resource or service which aids the   individual to improve or enhance any skill that unaided would hinder his/her   functional ability (e.g. switch technologies).  
  <LI><em>Augmentative ICT</em>: An ICT device that aids the individual to do   something that they could not otherwise do, for example, speech and communicator   devices.<BR>
    <em>These categories overlap. In essence assistive and augmentative   ICT is about enhancing an individual&rsquo;s interaction with their environment and is   most likely to be applied to physical and sensory disabilities. See <A href="external.html?link=http://www.inclusive.co.uk/" target="blank">Inclusive   Technology</A> for extensive examples.</em>
  <LI><em>Remedial ICT</em>: An ICT device, resource or service that provides   support to an individual for a specific cognitive or behavioural need. See the <A href="text_onlya821.html?url=/index.php&layout=1&sec=4&tp=11&ts=5">specific   learning difficulties</A> page for an example. Integrated Learning Systems (ILS)   such as SuccessMaker deliver individualised learning in maths, reading, writing   and spelling.  Each student has a learning programme continuously tailored to   personal needs; all students progress at their own level and pace and are free   to achieve within the security of their own private learning space. Learners,   teachers and mentors are supported throughout the process by diagnosis of   achievement and difficulty, delivered through continuously differentiated   learning resources and clear, detailed reporting. <A href="external.html?link=http://www.rm.com/" target="blank">SuccessMaker</A> and   search for "successmaker".  
  <LI><em>Diagnostic ICT</em>: An ICT device, resource or service that provides   information to teachers that facilitates the identification of a special   educational need and possibly suggests remedial courses of action. For example, <A href="external.html?link=http://www.snapassessment.com/intro.htm" target="blank">Special Needs Assessment Profile</A> which includes ICT tools and   other resources or the materials developed by <A href="external.html?link=http://www.lucid-research.com/" target="blank">Lucid</A>.</LI>
</UL>
The teacher of ICT is therefore in a key   position to work with SEN professionals in removing some of the barriers to   learning that exist in mainstream classrooms.<BR>
<BR>
For example, they will have   expertise in the use of control and switch technologies which may enable access   and improve communication for those with motor impairment; they will be able to   adjust hardware and modify software to accommodate those with poor sight or   hearing difficulties; they could set up independent learning programs for   children with emotional/behavioural disorders who may relate better to work on a   computer than when directed by a teacher. Computers often seem to provide a   preferred learning medium for children who are diagnosed with an autistic   spectrum condition.<BR>
<BR>
There is a wide range of devices that are used by   students with special educational needs to support their learning. The following   items are those most commonly found in schools. Some students need support   organising their studies and their learning. ICT provides a range of software   packages that enable the students to plan and organise their studies. Concept   mapping software, such as Inspiration, provides the means by which students can   show what they understand and prepare the content of their studies for later   revision.<BR>
<BR>
There are different special educational needs where the student   can benefit from having a recording of a lesson. Contemporary MP3 audio   recorders are discrete, do not require tapes and have no moving parts. The   recording can be easily transferred to a computer and copied to a CD for later   use and archiving.<BR>
<BR>
Spelling and grammar checkers enable students with   writing difficulties (especially those with dyslexia) to check their work and be   more confident in its public presentation. Some students find that handwriting   is slow and the resulting text impossible to use for revision and review. They   can use a range of text recording devices including tablet PCs, dedicated word   processors and XDAs. In most cases, students have to copy their typing into a PC   for further processing and archiving.<BR>

<H1><strong>Specific Learning Difficulties</strong></H1>
<p><BR>
  The most frequently   encountered learning difficulties are likely to be in the areas of cognitive   development that concern literacy and numeracy. Specific learning difficulties   (SpLD) are not disabilities in the physical sense and relate to aspects of   cognitive processing. Dyslexia, which relates to the learning of literacy   skills, is the most common of these. Estimates vary but it may be that   approximately 10 percent of the population is affected by dyslexia to some   degree.<BR>
  <BR>
  There are several other SpLD within the same syndrome which may   be present concurrently or independently. For example, &lsquo;dyscalculia&rsquo; refers to   difficulties with calculation and mathematical processing; &lsquo;dysgraphia&rsquo; refers   to difficulties with handwriting.<BR>
  <BR>
  Many adults who suffer from poor basic   skills may have undiagnosed specific learning difficulties. Their experience of   consequent failure may have impacted on their attitude to learning in general.   Dyslexia is perhaps the most common of the SpLD. It is not a single problem but   a wide range of cognitive difficulties that can be identified and supported by   providing different learning strategies. A good account of the learning   difficulties involved in Dyslexia is provided by the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.dfes.gov.uk/curriculum_literacy/access/dyslexia/" target="blank">DfES</A> (aimed at adult education but informative) and information   sheets are provided by the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/aboutdyslexia.html" target="blank">British Dyslexia Association</A> and <A href="external.html?link=http://www.becta.org.uk/" target="blank">BECTa</A>.<BR>
  <BR>
  A common aspect of dyslexia is that of scotopic   sensitivity, also known as the <A href="external.html?link=http://www.irlen.org.uk/" target="blank">Irlen</A> syndrome. This is a visual-perceptual problem triggered by one or more of the   components of light which effectively distort printed symbols. For many people   an adjustment in the contrast, using different colour combinations, can address   the problem. In some cases, the mere application of a coloured overlay to paper   has been found to make a significant improvement; for more serious cases   coloured lenses can be put into glasses. Using ICT, screen/font colours can be   changed very easily which can be used to test for preference and to resolve the   difficulties.<BR>
  <BR>
  ICT can be used in many ways to address some of the   problems encountered by dyslexics but it can also be used to identify or   diagnose their specific difficulty. An example of software that is particularly   effective in diagnosing aspects of dyslexia is <A href="external.html?link=http://www.devdis.com/cops.html" target="blank">Lucid   CoPS</A>. On-screen testing is provided to identify areas of difficulty in   different age groups. It is simple and quick to provide this in school without   the need to involve the educational psychology service.<BR>

<H1><strong>Supporting SEN in the ICT classroom</strong></H1>
<BR>
ICT can only provide a   set of resources and tools that may support or assist the pupil and the teacher   in meeting individual needs. There are no guarantees of success and certainly no   instant solutions.<BR>
<BR>
The ICT teacher is as dependent as anyone on the   expertise and advice of SEN specialists in addressing the learning needs of   individual pupils.<BR>
<BR>
The ICT teacher is also likely to experience similar   resource procurement and resource management difficulties to teachers of other   subjects. ICT that comes &lsquo;straight out of the box&rsquo; is well adapted to an   idealised user and much may need to be done to configure it in a suitable   fashion.<BR>
<BR>
The ICT teacher does however have a responsibility to understand   how to manipulate an ICT environment so that it can be used in appropriate ways   to support special educational needs. This includes not only understanding and   applying those built in features of the operating system that are designed for   users with special needs but also wider issues such as how to design online   materials so that they are accessible to all. <BR>
<BR>
As in all subjects, the   teacher/trainee has to consider the values and motivations in the subject area.   In ICT, the key word is &ldquo;capability&rdquo; &ndash; it is ensuring that students become   independent users of ICT, able to apply what they have learned to other   situations. As in all subject areas, it is then important to understand the   skills and needs of the learner. It is important to consider learning styles   including the visual-auditory-kinaesthetic and deep/surface models of learning   styles. A recommended read is Meeting SEN in the Curriculum - ICT by Mike North   and Sally McKeown. Their book identifies the sorts of ICT activity that is   associated with each style of learning. The book is a useful reminder that we   might be neglecting some learners when we use one method of teaching all the   time (North and McKeown, 2005, p72-74).<BR>
<BR>
Examples of ways to support the   visual approach: <BR>
screen images<BR>
flow diagrams, time lines<BR>
spider graphs   and mind mapping<BR>
video clips<BR>
vodcasts<BR>
animated images, Flash   files<BR>
web and video conferencing<BR>
emoticons (symbol based upon letters and   punctuation)<BR>
picons (icon based on a realistic picture) <BR>
<BR>
Audio   approaches include:<BR>
spoken instructions<BR>
talking word processor<BR>
sound   effects <BR>
earcons (buttons that emit a sound when   pressed)<BR>
podcasts<BR>
&ldquo;listen again&rdquo; web features<BR>
MP3 audio player   (including iPods)<BR>
MP3 audio recorder<BR>
<BR>
Examples of the kinaesthetic   approaches in ICT include:<BR>
presentations with audio games (based upon   joystick or key presses or mouse)<BR>
control technology (programmable   devices)<BR>
virtual reality<BR>
authoring: animations, presentations,   websites<BR>
copying instructions and demonstrations<BR>
skills   development<BR>
note taking during your expositions <BR>
<BR>
A further principle   associated with teaching the ICT curriculum to students with special educational   needs is that it is NOT &ldquo;watering it down&rdquo; or &ldquo;taking it slowly&rdquo;. They are   simply inappropriate and mis-guided approaches. The alternative curriculum,   whether in ICT or your own subject area, must ensure that the students gain a   sense of achievement in what they do. They should be presented with the same   number of achievable goals per lesson reflecting those set for the whole class. <BR>
<BR>

<H1><strong>Differentiation</strong></H1>
<BR>
Personalisation arising from the Every Child   Matters agenda brings renewed emphasis to the teacher's responsibility to ensure   all lessons are structured to accommodate the needs of individuals and groups of   pupils. Guidance on the particular forms of adaptation that may be required can   be obtained from formal statements that are constructed for particular   individuals. However, all teachers must also address the range of ability in   their classrooms. Even where students are not formally &lsquo;statemented&rsquo;, and thus   designated as SEN, differentiation is frequently required in order to ensure   that learning and teaching is matched effectively to an individual&rsquo;s   capability.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Differentiation:</strong><BR>
is a method of organising learning   activities;<BR>
is the match of what is offered to what is needed;<BR>
considers   the stage of learning that the learner has reached;<BR>
considers their own   skills and abilities;<BR>
<BR>
The National Curriculum Council (NCC) defined it   as:<BR>
<em>"the process by which curriculum objectives, teaching methods   assessment methods, resources and learning activities are planned to cater for   the needs of individual pupils"</em><BR>
<BR>
Among the most common forms of   educational need presenting themselves to the ICT teacher will be deficiencies   in literacy or numeracy. Differentiating teaching materials, learning tasks and   the classroom environment is an essential aspect of all effective teaching, not   least in the ICT classroom. Trainee teachers should to be encouraged to consider   imaginative and innovative ways in which ICT can be used to differentiate   support for such learning needs.<BR>
<BR>
For practical tasks where worksheet   support is required printed worksheets need to be carefully thought out in order   to make the best use of the range of typographical features that are available.   Similar tasks can be customised in a variety of ways to suit different levels of   ability.<BR>
<BR>
Where tasks can be presented on-screen the display features of   applications should be exploited so as to present information in clear and   readable ways. Colour schemes, controlled input fields using form fields or   ActiveX controls, custom dictionaries added to the spell checker and option   settings in the AutoCorrect function are all aspects of adjusting the working   environment to suit pupils of differing abilities.<BR>
<BR>
Simplification of the   interface is also easily achieved by customising menus and toolbars. Menus can   be created where these are helpful. Phrase banks can be created using the   AutoText feature. Default templates in applications, where these are used,   should also be adjusted (e.g. by setting default font sizes, colour schemes and   line spacing).<BR>
<BR>
Sound files can be included in any Office application to   provide additional aural support when appropriate and text-to-speech is now an   increasingly common feature in MSOffice and similar application suites. This too   can be utilised to ensure that pupils can access the informational aspects of   lesson material. Other tools such as <A href="external.html?link=http://www.microsoft.com/msagent/default.asp" target="blank">Microsoft Agent</A> can also be used to provide on-screen task   support.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Some questions that could be considered by   trainees:</strong><BR>
Are the objectives for the curriculum/software designed to   ensure that the work provides an appropriate challenge for all learners?<BR>
Does   the work offered build on prior learning?<BR>
Does the work offered allow for   learners to succeed at their own level?<BR>
Are activities planned to remove any   barriers to learner participation?<BR>
Are a range and variety of quality   resources available?<BR>
Do the activities reflect attention span and pace of   work?<BR>
Are all learners participating in the activity?<BR>
Is the activity(s)   the most effective way of achieving the outcome?<BR>
Are the resources matched to   the needs of the learners?<BR>
Can all learners access and use the resources they   need?<BR>
Can the learner work without continual reference to the teacher?<BR>
Are   learners helped to access resources and work at their best pace?<BR>
Is the   available adult time used differentially according to the needs of individuals   or groups?<BR>
Is the process of assessment an integral part of the   learning?<BR>
Are learning outcomes used to plan future work?<BR>
Is the learner   involved in an assessment of their learning and progress?<BR>
Does the process   result in the learner gaining a greater understanding of their future   needs?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Differentiation has implications for equal opportunities -   that is a useful discussion to be undertaken with trainees.<BR>
