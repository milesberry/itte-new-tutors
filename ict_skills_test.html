<H2><B>ICT Skills Test</B></H2>
<br>To be awarded QTS, all trainees much pass tests in literacy, numeracy and ICT. These tests are delivered online through a series of test centres located around the country. Not all training providers opted to have test centres located on their sites and so you might find your trainees have to book into test centres at other training providers. The booking arrangements are managed via the TDA website – training providers have no influence over when, where and how often their trainees take the tests.<br><br>All training providers are issued with sets of  Skills Test registration numbers for their final year trainees at the start of each academic year. Once these are distributed, trainee sneed to register to obtain a log-in and password which is emailed to them. They can then book their tests online via the link on the TDA website. They are given the results of each test immediately after it has been taken, but must wait for 24 hours before rebooking should they fail.<br><br>As an ICT tutor, you might be expected to prepare trainees for the ICT QTS Skills test. The following table provides an overview of the key skills featured in the test. Trainees will not be tested on all aspects in any one test, but the questions are drawn from a bank which covers all the following aspects. <br><br><b><i>Key skills covered by the QTS Skills Test:</b><br><br><div align="center"><table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr><td valign="top"><B><I>General skills</B><BR><BULLET>Choosing appropriate software to help solve a problem <BR>Dragging and dropping <BR>Having more than one application open at a time <BR>Highlighting <BR>Making selections by clicking <BR>Moving information between software (e.g. Using the clipboard) <BR>Navigating around the desktop environment <BR>Loading and saving files<BR>Navigating between folders and sub-folders<BR>Opening items by double clicking with the mouse <BR>Printing <BR>Using menus <BR>Changing the name of files<BR></BULLET></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><B><I>Word processing skills</B><BR>Altering fonts - font, size, style (bold, italic, underline)<BR>Text justification - left, right and centre <BR>Using a spellchecker <BR>Moving text within a document with 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste'<BR>Adding or inserting pictures to a document <BR>Counting the number of words in a document <BR>Adding a page break to a document <BR>Altering page orientation – (landscape, portrait)<BR>Using Characters/Symbols <BR>Using find and replace to edit a document <BR>Using styles to organise a document <BR>Using styles to alter the presentation of a document efficiently<BR>Adding page numbers to the footer of a document <BR>Adding the date to the header of a document <BR>Changing the margins of a document </td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><B><I>E-mail skills</B><BR>Recognising an e-mail address <BR>Sending an e-mail to an individual <BR>Sending an e-mail to more than one person<BR>Replying to an e-mail<BR>Copying an e-mail to another person <BR>Forwarding an incoming e-mail to another person <BR>Adding an address to an electronic address book<BR>Filing incoming and outgoing e-mails <BR>Adding an attachment to an e-mail <BR>Receiving and saving an attachment from an e-mail </td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><B><I>Web browser skills</B><BR>Recognising a web address (e.g. www or co.uk, etc.)<BR>Using hyperlinks on websites to connect to other website<BR>Using the back button <BR>Using the forward button <BR>Using the history <BR>Understanding how to search websites<BR>Using Boolean operators (and/or/not) to narrow down searches<BR>Creating bookmarks<BR>Organising bookmarks into folders <BR>Downloading files from a website</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><B><I>Spreadsheet skills</B><BR>Identifying grid squares in a spreadsheet (e.g. B5)<BR>Inserting columns into a spreadsheet <BR>Inserting rows into a spreadsheet <BR>Sorting spreadsheet or database columns in ascending or descending order <BR>Converting a spreadsheet into a chart <BR>Labelling a chart <BR>Adding simple formulae/functions to cells <BR>Applying formatting to different types of data including numbers and dates </td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><B><I>Presentation skills</B><BR>Inserting text and images on a slide<BR>Inserting a slide in a presentation <BR>Adding a transition between slides <BR>Adding buttons to a presentation <BR>Using timers in a presentation</td></tr></table></div><br><br>From September 2008, the ICT test format has been revised and so you may need to alert students to the changes, particularly if they are referring to guidance which may now be outdated. In summary, the main changes are:<ul><li>the students are no longer tested on the use of a database</li><li>the tasks are no longer centred on one central theme - these now vary according to the application forming the focus for the task</li><li>students will be expected to navigate around folders and sub-folders to find and save files</li><li>the marking is much more rigorous and hence the benchmark for passing has been raised</li></ul>Those who are familiar with the previous version of the tests will not notice any immediate differences, but should find that the tasks are a little more demanding and slightly more realistic - given the artificiality and limitations of the testing environment. It is strongly recommended that that the trainees try at least one practice test before booking a test, as the ICT environment presented in the test is somewhat idiosyncratic and can confuse even the most confident ICT user.<br><br>A further development of which all ITT tutors should be aware is that from August 31st 2008, the five year period of grace allowed for passing the tests has been removed. Previously, students who had not passed all their skills tests could teach in schools as an unqualified teacher for up to five years, during which time they could retake the tests until passed.
