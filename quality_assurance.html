<H2>Quality Assurance</H2>
<br>This page contains information about <b>quality assurance frameworks</B> that may help you to design and evaluate your courses. <br><br>Strategies for assuring the quality of your courses are a necessity.  They will provide you with objective evidence of what is working well and what needs to be improved.  Also, in England, is a requirement that providers of initial teacher training courses monitor and evaluate the quality of their provision.  See <a href="external.html?link=http://www.tda.gov.uk/partners/ittstandards/guidance_08.aspx" target="blank">ITT requirements guidance</a> R2.2 and R3.6.   ITT provision in England is inspected by Ofsted in accordance with the latest published inspection framework, which is currently <a href="external.html?link=http://ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Forms-and-guidance/Browse-all-by/Other/General/Framework-for-the-inspection-of-initial-teacher-education-2008-11" target="blank">Framework for the inspection of initial teacher education 2008-2011</a>.  It is always a good idea to find out what inspectors will be looking for and check how your courses fare against their criteria.<br><br>In addition to the TDA and Ofsted, the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) provides a range of guidance related to <a href="external.html?link=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/academicinfrastructure/default.asp" target="blank">academic standards and quality</a>.  It includes sections on programme specifications, subject benchmark standards (for generic Computing and Education courses) and a framework for higher education qualifications.<br><br>Your institution may have a generic quality assurance framework that you will need to adopt.  <br><br>As well as helping you to evaluate your existing course(s), these frameworks may help if you are designing a new course by identifying components, criteria and quality assurance checks to include in it.<br><br>As you will undoubtedly be making use of <B>e-learning and e-teaching</B> in your courses, you may find that none of the QA frameworks enable you to take sufficient account of either of these approaches. You may find the following resources helpful as a source for ideas to incorporate into your own quality assurance procedures:<br> <br><B>A benchmarking tool for quality assessment in e-learning</B> has been developed by the European Association of Distance Teaching Universities (EADTU). <br><a href="external.html?link=http://www.eadtu.nl/e-xcellenceQS/files/members/E-xcellenceManualGrey/PedagogicDesign.html" target="blank"><i>E-xcellence</I></a>.  It is intended as a supplement to, not a replacement for, existing institutional or national quality assurance frameworks.  An important aspect of this resource is that "it offers a European-wide set of benchmarks, independent of particular institutional or national systems".<br><br><b><a href="external.html?link=http://www.naace.org.uk/ictmark" target="blank">ICT Mark</a></B> for Schools and <b><a href="external.html?link=http://www.naace.org.uk/naacemarkedservices/624" target="blank">Naacemark for Service Providers</a></B> provide useful criteria and offer accreditation for organisations that meet them.<br><br><br><B>Further reading</B><br><br>Although these articles relate to professional development for in-service teachers, the criteria discussed for judging the effectiveness of programmes have some validity in initial teacher education.<br><br>Davis, N., Preston, C., & Sahin, I., (2007) <I><a href="external.html?link=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120173681/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0" target="blank">ICT teacher training: Evidence for multilevel evaluation from a national initiative</a></i>, British Journal of Educational Technology, Volume 40, Issue 1, pages 135-148,  published online 2008.<br><br>Guskey, T.
