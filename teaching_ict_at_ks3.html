<H2>Teaching ICT At Key Stage 3</H2>
<p><br>
  Key Stage 3 is defined as the education of pupils in years 7, 8 and 9 (aged 11 - 14 years) and is characterised as a number of subjects  taught compulsorily and separately with no final, summative or accredited assessment. In England the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) specifies the content of the curriculum and the characteristics of the levels of attainment called the National Curriculum. The QCA has developed a curriculum <a href="external.html?link=http://www.qca.org.uk/libraryAssets/media/Big_Picture_2008.pdf" target="blank">big picture</a> to reinforce the concept of curriculum as the entire planned learning experience of a young person and shows the range of subjects and the spectrum of activities. <a href="external.html?link=http://www.qca.org.uk/libraryAssets/media/Big_Picture_2008.pdf" target="blank">http://www.qca.org.uk/libraryAssets/media/Big_Picture_2008.pdf</a><br><br>The <a href="external.html?link=http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/" target="blank">National Strategies</a> website is the definitive source of authorised information regarding how the curriculum should be delivered from early years (aged 4) to 16.

<H1>National Strategy<BR>
  The ICT Strand</H1>
<BR>
The Key Stage 3 Strategy for ICT   Capability(2002) has been superseded by the ICT strand of the National Strategy   which provides guidance and resources for teachers at <BR>
<BR>
<A href="external.html?link=http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/secondary/secondaryframeworks/ictframework" target="blank">http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/secondary/secondaryframeworks/ictframework</A><BR>
<BR>
The   original strategy materials included a Framework to support the planning,   teaching and assessment of ICT and a number of sample teaching units (STU) for   Years 7, 8 and 9, with detailed lesson plans that exemplified effective teaching   of ICT capability. <em>These remain a useful resource</em> to exemplify long and   medium term planning and the structure of lessons. The Framework introduced   concepts of ICT capability, starters and plenaries, miniplenaries and yearly   teaching objectives. <BR>
<BR>
The Secondary Strategy focuses on a number of   generic areas which impact upon the teaching of ICT at Key Stage 3 including:   behaviour, attendance, and social and emotional aspects of learning (SEAL);   pedagogy (whole school approaches); assessment for learning; functional skills   in literacy, numeracy and ICT and "intervention".<BR>
<BR>
Intervention is the   concept of securing the learning of all pupils in mainstream lessons through   tailored intervention support programmes and specialised, individualised   provision that accelerate and maximise pupils' progress and to minimise   performance gaps. Aspects of intervention include progression maps, study plus   and the role of the teaching assistant. <A href="external.html?link=http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/secondary/intervention" target="blank">http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/secondary/intervention</A><BR>
<BR>
The   renewed ICT Framework builds on the original Framework published in 2002, and is   designed to <em>"increase pupils' access to excellent teaching, and engaging,   purposeful learning that will enable them to make good progress through Key   Stage 3 and Key Stage 4"</em>.<BR>
<BR>
The Framework is structured:<BR>
<BR>
to   provide guidance on planning and teaching; <BR>
<BR>
to incorporate existing   guidance on day-to-day and periodic assessment; <BR>
<BR>
to increase the emphasis   on the key concepts, key processes and functional skills; <BR>
<BR>
to build on   what pupils have learned in Key Stage 2; <BR>
<BR>
to ensure that ICT skills are   integrated with knowledge and understanding in a range of contexts; and <BR>
<BR>
to support planning and to build on existing National Strategies   resources.<BR>
<BR>
It strongly reflects the four strands of the National   Curriculum - finding information, developing ideas, communicating information   and evaluating. It interprets those in terms of the knowledge, skills and   understanding associated with each.<BR>
<BR>
When "finding information" in Key   Stage 3 pupils should understand that Information items come in different forms   and from different sources. Keywords include: searching, selecting, search   engines, Boolean searches, data sets, organising, investigating, purpose, scope,   processing, retrieval<BR>
<BR>
When "developing ideas" the pupils should   understand that use of ICT can increase the efficiency of information processing   and that processes can be speeded up using automation. Keywords include: models,   modelling, representation, system, conditions, input, rules, outcomes,   sequencing, instructions, control, plan, predict.<BR>
<BR>
When "communicating   information" pupils should understand that it is <em>"important to be selective   and sensitive in what we present to a particular audience or community and   engage in critical reflection on how others present fact and opinions or   materials to publicise or entertain".</em> Keywords include: fitness for purpose,   communication, environment, audience expectations, needs, refining, presenting,   text, images, sounds, formatting, risk management, security.<BR>
<BR>
When   "evaluating" pupils should be encouraged to make self-assessments of their work   to develop their ability to provide and respond to critical feedback. Keywords   include: user interface, efficiency, usefulness of a system, systematic testing,   complex and rigorous success criteria, user feedback, balancing competing   demands.<BR>
<BR>
The structure of the Framework for secondary ICT also presents   the curriculum as a two-dimensional grid of objectives arranged vertically by   year group from Year 7 to Year 11, and horizontally in four strands of   progression across the secondary age range.<BR>
<BR>
The Framework also provides   guidance on the value of planning schemes of work in ICT, how a curriculum map   is formed, the role of learning objectives, unit plans and a teaching   calendar.<BR>

<H1>Ofsted Perspective <BR>
  Key Stage 3 teaching of ICT</H1>
<BR>
Issues raised by   Ofsted in relation to teaching and learning in ICT include: <BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Teachers should ensure all planned work is completed  
  <LI>Teachers should be more systematic at checking pupil understanding  
  <LI>Teachers should ensure adequate feedback is given to ensure that pupils know   what and how to improve ICT  
  <LI>Plenaries should be long enough for teachers to summarise what has been   learnt and to discuss what will be learnt in the next lesson  
  <LI>Teachers need to make better use of manageable assessment opportunities,   including pupil self assessment</LI>
</UL>
For full details of the issues see the   Ofsted publication: Ofsted (2003) <em><A href="external.html?link=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Publications-and-research/Browse-all-by/Education/Key-stages-and-transition/Key-Stage-3/The-Key-Stage-3-Strategy-evaluation-of-the-second-year/(language)/eng-GB" target="blank">The Key Stage 3 Strategy: Evaluation of the Second Year</A></em> pp17-19 London, UK: Ofsted<BR>
<BR>
More recently, the 2005 Ofsted report   highlights, amongst other issues, these findings that could influence ITT ICT   course planning:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Teachers need to give more consideration to the circumstances in which   independent learning using ICT can flourish.   
  <LI>Assessment of ICT capability remains a weakness in one fifth of schools at   Key Stage 3 and one eighth at Key Stage 4.   
  <LI>The use of assessment to respond to the needs of individual pupils remains   very variable, especially at Key Stage 3 where it is unsatisfactory in almost   one fifth of schools. </LI>
</UL>
Ofsted (2005). <A href="external.html?link=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/News/News-Archive/2005/October/Annual-Report-2004-05-published/(language)/eng-GB" target="blank">Information and communication technology in secondary schools.</A> The Annual Report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools 2004. [Online].   London, UK: Ofsted <BR>
<BR>
In their observations of lessons and discussions with   teachers, trainees may find it helpful to focus on one or more of these issues   in order to develop their own ideas about what constitutes effective   practice.<BR>
<BR>
The Annual Report of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Chief Inspector of Schools   2005/06 reports,<BR>
<BR>
<em>"in some subjects in secondary schools, the quality   of provision is affected by high levels of staff turnover and difficulties in   recruiting appropriately qualified staff; this is particularly the case in   science,mathematics, information and communication technology (ICT) and design   and technology, including food technology."</em><BR>
<BR>
The Annual Report of Her   Majesty&rsquo;s Chief Inspector of Education, Children&rsquo;s Services and Skills 2006/07   reports,<BR>
<BR>
<em>"Secondary schools offer an increasing number of vocational   courses to pupils aged 14 to 19 years, making the curriculum more relevant and   motivating for many learners and encouraging them to attend and to learn.   However, the curriculum for information and communication technology (ICT) in   Key Stage 4 is not improving, and the development of ICT skills to support   learning across the curriculum remains too dependent on the expertise of   individual subject teachers. Schools in all phases are providing an increasing   range of extra-curricular activities, which help to motivate and engage pupils." </em><BR>

<H1>The National Curriculum <BR>
  for Key Stage 3 ICT</H1>
<BR>
This section   contains an outline of the National Curriculum for England for ICT at key stage   3. It was first published by QCA in 2007 and came into force in schools from   September 2008 for year 7. The claim is that the new National Curriculum will   provide:
<UL>
  <LI>Greater flexibility and coherence  
  <LI>New focus on aims and skills  
  <LI>Greater personalisation through assessment and qualifications  
  <LI>Greater coherence through a common structure across all   subjects</LI>
</UL>
Greater flexibility and coherence is achieved through   tailoring learning to the learners&rsquo; needs by having less prescribed subject   content. Pupils will still be taught essential subject knowledge but the new   curriculum balances subject knowledge with the key concepts and processes that   underlie the discipline of each subject.<BR>
<BR>
The revised programmes of study   for all subjects share a common format which includes:
<UL>
  <LI>an importance statement &ndash; why the subject matters.  
  <LI>key concepts &ndash; identifies the big ideas that underpin the subject  
  <LI>key processes &ndash; identifies the essential skills of the subject  
  <LI>range and content &ndash; outlines the breadth of subject matter</LI>
</UL>
<p>The   curriculum is described in terms of knowledge, concepts and skills. A further   section identifies opportunities to enhance and enrich learning, including   making links to the wider curriculum such as enterprise, creativity, and   cultural understanding and diversity.<BR>
  <BR>
  What has changed and why is   summarised in the document <A href="external.html?link=http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/uploads/overview_doc_tcm8-1839.pdf" target="blank">http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/uploads/overview_doc_tcm8-1839.pdf</A><BR>
  <BR>
  The   complete programme of study for ICT key stage 3 is available from <A href="external.html?link=http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/uploads/QCA-07-3336-p_ICT_KS3_tcm8-401.pdf" target="blank">http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/uploads/QCA-07-3336-p_ICT_KS3_tcm8-401.pdf</A>.<BR>
  <BR>
  The   importance of information and communication technology is...<BR>
  <BR>
  The   increasing use of technology in all aspects of society makes <strong>confident,   creative and productive use of ICT an essential skill for life</strong>. ICT   capability encompasses not only the mastery of technical skills and techniques,   but also the understanding to apply these skills purposefully, safely and   responsibly in learning, everyday life and employment. ICT capability is   fundamental to participation and engagement in modern society. <BR>
  <BR>
  ICT can   be used to <strong>find, develop, analyse and present information, as well as to   model situations and solve problems. ICT enables rapid access to ideas and   experiences</strong> from a wide range of people, communities and cultures, and   allows pupils to collaborate and exchange information on a wide scale. <strong>ICT   acts as a powerful force for change in society</strong> and citizens should have an   understanding of the social, ethical, legal and economic implications of its   use, including how to use ICT safely and responsibly. Increased capability in   the use of <strong>ICT supports initiative and independent learning,</strong> as pupils   are able to make informed judgements about when and where to use ICT to enhance   their learning and the quality of their work.<BR>

<H1>Teaching and learning processes<BR>
  in Key Stage 3</H1>
<BR>
Putting the   National Strategy into practice has caused schools to refocus attention on   teaching and learning processes rather than the delivery of content. These   approaches are closely associated with the theories linked to accelerated   learning. Accelerated learning is an umbrella term for a series of practical   approaches to learning which uses new knowledge about how the brain functions   when learning. Accelerated learning takes the new knowledge about the way   students learn and puts it into a manageable way of working in the classroom. It   forms the cornerstone of the Learning Framework adopted within the Strategy and   beyond.<BR>
<BR>
An excellent introduction to current thinking on accelerated   learning is contained in <em>Learning: A Sense Maker&rsquo;s Guide</em> published by the   Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL). Further information and purchase   details are available in the resources section on the ATL website <A href="external.html?link=http://www.atl.org.uk/" target="blank">http://www.atl.org.uk</A><BR>
<BR>
An important publication in the   Pedagogy and Practice: Teaching and Learning in Secondary Schools series is the   Using ICT to enhance learning (Unit 15) that describes practical strategies for   teachers to use to enhance learning through the use of ICT. The techniques   suggested are tried and tested; they draw both on academic research and the   experience of practising teachers. An early Ofsted report identified the issues   arising from the need to develop pupils&rsquo; ICT capability to enhance their   learning. <BR>
<BR>
<em>&ldquo;The past five years have seen a slow but steady   improvement in pupils&rsquo; achievements in ICT capability, the quality of teaching,   and the leadership and management of ICT ... The complementary use of ICT across   subjects, however, has been slow to develop and is uneven across schools and   subjects ... The effective balance between the teaching of ICT skills, knowledge   and understanding on the one hand and the application of these as part of   learning across subjects on the other hand remains a difficult and elusive goal   for the majority of schools.&rdquo; </em>(Ofsted, 2004)<BR>
