<H2>Assessment of Trainees</H2>
<br><div align="left"><table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr><td valign="top"><B>Assessment in secondary schools</B><BR><BR>2. A consistent message of Ofsted reports over several years has been the indifferent quality of assessment compared with other aspects of teaching in secondary schools. The Annual Report 2000/01 shows the quality and use of ongoing assessment to be good or better in only 37% of schools inspected. By contrast, teachers’ general professional knowledge and understanding are good in 90% of the schools, with teachers’ planning of a similar quality in 74%.<BR><BR>3. One problem is that marking to inform pupils of their progress is inconsistent, with teachers often giving insufficient guidance to pupils about how to improve their work and providing few opportunities for pupils to reflect on comments. Another problem is that reports to parents are sometimes weakened by bland writing that fails to describe strengths and weaknesses clearly enough or by a lack of information that shows how pupils are achieving in relation to national standards. Their usefulness can also be affected by varied formats that make comparisons between subjects difficult.<BR><BR>HMI (2003) <I>Good assessment in secondary schools</I> HMI462 p1</td></tr></table></div><br><div align="left"><table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr><td valign="top">Can assessment raise standards? Recent research has shown that the answer to this question is an unequivocal ‘yes’. Assessment is one of the most powerful educational tools for promoting effective learning. But it must be used in the right way. There is no evidence that increasing the amount of testing will enhance learning. Instead the focus needs to be on helping teachers use assessment, as part of teaching and learning, in ways that will raise pupils’ achievement.<BR><BR>Assessment Reform Group (1999), <I>Assessment for Learning: Beyond the Black Box.</I> University of Cambridge School of Education.&nbsp;</td></tr></table></div><br>When working with trainees we are dealing with assessment at 3 levels: firstly we need to teach them about the assessment process and procedures so that they can implement and develop their own knowledge, understanding and skills with their own learners. Secondly, we need to provide a framework for assessing the trainees against the current standards for QTS (some of which relate to the first item above). Whilst finally, on many courses there is a need to assess the trainees in a formal academic manner. In the last two it is important that we model good practice in the context of the first item.<br><br><b>Academic assessment</b><br>Most institutes of Higher Education will have a teaching, learning and assessment policy and strategy. This is key to any tutors understanding of how their institution works and needs to be understood and adopted, along with the assessment regulations of the institute.<br><br>Just as when working with younger learners we need to be very clear about our expectations and what will be needed to achieve success at the academic level being attempted, be it level 1, 2 or M level. Generic and programme/course level descriptors probably exist and need to be considered when setting and assessing assignments and other assessed tasks.<br><br>If you have access to a Learning and Teaching Coordinator then they will probably be the best person to provide advice and direction in your institution. The <a href="external.html?link=http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/" target="blank">Higher Education Academy</a>  probably provides the best focus for development work in this area. All HE tutors can register as membership is paid for from an institutional 'top-slice'.<br><br><b>Teaching about assessment in Schools</b><br>The seminal item on this is Black, P. J. & Wiliam, D.

If these are then put on to CD and used with small groups on a mentor training session they can pause and rewind under their own control. They can then focus on particular aspects of the lesson. Unfortunately there are no case studies available centrally (a permission to use issue) so it would be necessary for a department to author their own.<br><br><br>author: Neil Stanley<br>
